            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Lipids are transported in the blood complexed to proteins called apo-lipoproteins. Abnormalities of this lipid transport or metabolism result in hyperlipoproteinemias, which are responsible for most syndromes of premature atherosclerosis. The primary hyperlipidemias are divided into five distinct electrophoretic patterns. Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, caused by a mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene, results in increased chylomicrons and triglycerides. Type II hyperlipoproteinemia, perhaps the most frequent Mendelian disorder, is caused by a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. This results in increased LDL and cholesterol. Homozygotes for this gene defect have markedly increased plasma cholesterol levels and develop severe atherosclerosis at an early age. Xanthomas of the Achilles tendon are somewhat specific for this disorder. Mutations in the apolipoprotein E gene result in type III hyperlipoproteinemia, which is characterized by increased intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), triglycerides, and cholesterol. Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia causes increased very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and triglycerides. The genetic defect causing this abnormality is a mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene. Type V hyperlipoproteinemia, caused by a mutation in apolipoprotein CII, results in increased VLDLs, chylomicrons, triglycerides, and cholesterol."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Increased serum lipids (hyperlipidemia) may be a primary genetic defect or may be secondary to another disorder, such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, the nephrotic syndrome, or hypothyroidism. Secondary hypertriglyceridemia in patients with diabetes mellitus usually occurs secondary to increased blood levels of VLDL. The reason for this is that with decreased levels of insulin with diabetes mellitus there is increased mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (increased lipolysis). This increases delivery of free fatty acids to the liver, which increases production and secretion of VLDL by the liver. This is a type IV hyperlipidemia pattern. Ethanol can also produce a type IV pattern due to increased VLDL. This is because ethanol also increases lipolysis of adipose tissue, which increases delivery of free fatty acids to the liver. Ethanol also increases the esterification of fatty acid to triglycerides in the liver and inhibits the release of lipoproteins from the liver."

            explanation: "There are various risk factors that predispose individuals to the development of atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. These risk factors are either quite significant (major factors) or less significant (minor factors). Major factors include diet and hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia), hypertension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Minor risk factors include obesity, lack of physical exercise, male gender, stress, oral contraceptives (birth control pills), and hyperhomocystinemia. Another minor risk factor is the presence in the serum of lipoprotein(a), which is an altered form of LDL, that contains the apoprotein B100 linked to apoprotein(a). This special type of apoprotein has structural homology to plasminogen. These similar areas are called kringles because they resemble a type of Danish pastry. It is thought that, because of the similarity of structure, Lp(a) competes with plasminogen in clots and decreases the ability to form plasmin and clear clots."

            explanation: "The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis depends in part on the inflammatory function of macrophages, which involves the release of numerous cytokines. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is mitogenic and chemotactic for smooth-muscle cells. This may explain the recruitment and proliferation of smooth-muscle cells in atherosclerosis. Other macrophage products participate in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis by other means. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transform the normally anticoagulant endothelial surface into a procoagulant surface by stimulating endothelial cells to produce platelet-activating factor (PAF), tissue factor (TF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). Interferon alpha and transforming growth factor beta inhibit cell proliferation. This could explain the failure of endothelial cells to repair endothelial defects. These defects could then either provide entry areas for lipoproteins and plasma-derived factors or serve as an area where thrombi are formed."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "Hypertension is associated with two forms of damage to small blood vessels: hyaline arteriolosclerosis and hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis, which is also a vascular complication of patients with diabetes mellitus, is presumably caused by leakage of plasma components across the endothelium. Microscopic examination will reveal the lumens of small arterioles to be narrowed by homogenous pink (hyaline) deposits in the walls. These changes within the kidney are referred to as benign nephrosclerosis, in which the decreased blood supply causes loss of nephrons and a characteristic finely granular appearance to the kidney surface. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is associated with benign hypertension. In contrast, hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis is associated with malignant hypertension, which refers to dramatic elevations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure often resulting in early death from cerebral and brainstem hemorrhages. Pathologically, the renal vessels demonstrate a concentric obliteration of arterioles by an increase in smooth-muscle cells and protein deposition in a laminar configuration (onionskining) that includes fibrin material, which leads to total and subtotal occlusion of the vessels. These changes are called hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. Medial calcific sclerosis (Mnckeberg’s arteriosclerosis) is characterized by dystrophic calcification in the tunica media of muscular arteries. There is no narrowing of the lumen of the affected vessels. Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s disease) is occlusion by a proliferative inflammatory process in arteries of heavy cigarette smokers and is often associated with HLA-A9,B5 genotypes. Finally, the term “arteriosclerosis obliterans” refers to arteriosclerosis of the extremities (peripheral vascular disease)."

Immunofluorescence reveals ANCAs to have two different patterns. One is directed toward myeloperoxidase of neutrophils and is found in a perinuclear location (P-ANCAs). This pattern is seen in patients with microscopic PAN or idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis without systemic disease. Microscopic PAN commonly involves glomerular and pulmonary capillaries and may produce hematuria, hemoptysis, and renal failure. Histologic sections reveal segmental fibrinoid necrosis. The other ANCA pattern reveals the antibodies to be directed against neutral leukocyte protease (proteinase 3) and results in a cytoplasmic staining pattern (C-ANCAs).

The differential diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis includes microscopic PAN and three other disorders: Henoch-Schnlein purpura, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Henoch-Schnlein purpura is a disorder of children who present with hemorrhagic urticaria and hematuria following an upper respiratory infection. The pathology of this disease involves the deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in small vessels of the skin. Because the antibody is IgA, the alternate complement pathway is activated in these patients. Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) is characterized by acute necrotizing granulomas of the upper and lower respiratory tract, focal necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels, and renal disease. Histologically there is fibrinoid necrosis of small arteries, early infiltration by neutrophils, and granuloma formation with giant cells. The peak incidence is in the fifth decade, and many patients have C-ANCAs. The disease is highly fatal, with death occurring within 1 year, unless recognized and treated with immunosuppressive agents. Churg-Strauss syndrome (allergic vasculitis) is a form of necrotizing vasculitis with granulomas of the respiratory tract and asthma.

It used to be found exclusively in men, but recently there has been an increase in the number of reported cases in women. The vessels primarily affected are in the extremities, and this leads to painful ischemia and gangrene of the legs and arms due to thrombosis. Histologic sections reveal an acute inflammatory infiltrate involving the entire wall of the vessel. In contrast to atherosclerosis, small microabscesses may be seen within thrombi. The inflammation leads to intimal proliferation that obliterates the lumen and causes pain. The disease may regress on cessation of smoking. In contrast, granulomatous inflammation with giant cells involving blood vessels can be seen with temporal arteritis or Takayasu’s arteritis.

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "An aneurysm is an abnormal dilation of any vessel. The causes of aneurysms are many, but the two most important ones are atherosclerosis and cystic medial necrosis. Atherosclerotic aneurysms, the most common type of aortic aneurysms, usually occur distal to the renal arteries and proximal to the bifurcation of the aorta. Many atherosclerotic aneurysms are asymptomatic, but if they rupture they produce sudden, severe abdominal pain, shock, and a risk of death. Prior to rupture, physical examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Cystic medial necrosis refers to the focal loss of elastic and muscle fibers in the media of vessels and is seen in patients with hypertension, dissecting aneurysms, and Marfan’s syndrome. Trauma may also lead to the formation of dissecting aneurysms. Berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of arteries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms are caused by obliterative endarteritis of the vasa vasorum of the aorta. These aneurysms are part of the tertiary manifestation of syphilis and become evident 15 to 20 years after persons have contracted the initial infection with Treponema pallidum. Elastic tissue and smooth-muscle cells of the media undergo ischemic destruction as a result of the treponemal infection (obliterative endarteritis). As a consequence of ischemia in the media, musculoelastic support is lost and fibrosis occurs. Grossly, the aorta has a “tree-bark” appearance. Luetic aneurysms almost always occur in the thoracic aorta and may lead to luetic heart disease by producing insufficiency of the aortic valve (aortic regurgitation)."

            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Dissecting aneurysms are usually the result of cystic medial necrosis of the aorta. This abnormality results from loss of elastic tissue in the media and is associated with hypertension and Marfan’s syndrome. Most cases of dissecting aneurysms involve a transverse tear in the intima and are located in the ascending aorta, just above the aortic ring. The pain caused by a dissecting aneurysm is similar to the pain caused by a myocardial infarction, but it extends into the abdomen as the dissection progresses. Additionally, the blood pressure is not decreased with a dissecting aneurysm unless the aorta itself has ruptured. In contrast, berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of arteries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Rupture of these aneurysms may produce a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Berry aneurysms have been noted in about one-sixth of patients with adult polycystic renal disease and account for death in about 10% of patients with this type of polycystic renal disease. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms occur in the thoracic aorta and may lead to luetic heart disease by producing insufficiency of the aortic valve. Mycotic (infectious) aneurysms result from microbial infection during septicemia, usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis. They are prone to rupture and hemorrhage. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of eight syndromes characterized by defects in collagen synthesis. In EDS IV there is deficient synthesis of type III collagen and a tendency to rupture of muscular arteries, including dissecting aneurysms of the aorta."

            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Benign tumors of vessels may originate from either blood vessels or lymphatics. Lymphangiomas are tumors that are derived from lymphatic vessels. Histologically they reveal dilated vessels lined by endothelial cells, but they lack red blood cells in their lumen. The absence of red blood cells helps to distinguish these lesions from hemangiomas. Cystic hygromas are cystic lymphangiomas that typically occur in the neck or axilla. They may grow to such a large size that the neck is deformed. These lesions may be found in patients with Turner’s syndrome, an abnormality that results from complete or partial monosomy for the X chromosome. Swelling of the neck in these individuals occurs because of dilated lymphatic vessels. With time the swelling decreases, but patients may develop bilateral neck webbing and loose skin on the back of the neck. In contrast, dilated blood vessels (vascular ectasia) may be congenital or acquired. “Birthmarks” may be caused by congenital vascular ectasia (nevus flammeus) or capillary hemangiomas. “Port-wine stains” are similar lesions that may be caused by vascular ectasia or cavernous hemangiomas of the skin. Spider angiomas are acquired vascular ectasias that are the result of increased estrogen levels. They are associated with pregnancy and liver disease. Bacillary angiomatosis is a nonneoplastic proliferation of blood vessels that is found in immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with AIDS. Histologically, there are proliferating capillaries that are lined by protuberant endothelial cells. Additionally, numerous neutrophils are present along with nuclear dust and purple granules. These latter granules are Rickettsia-like bacteria that are the cause of this lesion, which responds to erythromycin."

Hemangiomas may be subclassified as capillary or cavernous. The juvenile (strawberry) hemangioma is a fast-growing lesion that appears in the first few months of life, but most completely regresses by the age of 5 years. Unless near the eye, definitive therapy is usually not indicated, as the possible techniques, such as surgery, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and injection of sclerosing drugs, all cause more scarring than is produced by spontaneous resolution."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) comprises four distinct forms. The classic, or European, form has been known since 1862. It occurs in older men of Eastern European or Mediterranean origin (predominantly Italian or Jewish) and is characterized by purple maculopapular skin lesions of the lower extremities and visceral involvement in only 10% of cases. The African form occurs in younger people and is more aggressive; it often involves lymph nodes in children. The rare form in immunosuppressed recipients of renal transplants often regresses when immunosuppression stops. In the epidemic form associated with AIDS, skin lesions may occur anywhere and disseminate to the mucous membranes, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lymph nodes, and viscera. Histologic determination is difficult, but all four clinical types appear similar. In the early stages, irregular, dilated epidermal vascular spaces, extravasated red cells, and hemosiderin are characteristic. This histologic appearance is very similar to that of granulation tissue or stasis dermatitis. Later in the disease process, more characteristic lesions show spindle cells around slit spaces with extravasation of erythrocytes. In contrast, irregular vascular spaces lined by nests of uniform cells describe the histologic appearance of a glomus tumor, while multiple dilated endothelial-lined vessels that lack red blood cells describe the histologic appearance of lymphangiomas. Numerous neutrophils, nuclear dust, and purple granules characterize bacillary angiomatosis, while proliferating blood vessels, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts suggest granulation tissue."

            ],
            correct: 2,
            explanation: "The heart will eventually fail to maintain cardiac output if it is forced to work in an abnormal state for a prolonged period of time. The symptoms produced by congestive heart failure relate to whether the failure involves the left side of the heart or the right side of the heart. Symptoms of acute left ventricular failure include pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hypoxia, while chronic left ventricular failure will produce dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea (trouble breathing when lying down), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and eventually right heart failure. There are many causes of congestive heart failure, but basically they produce either systolic dysfunction or diastolic dysfunction. Systolic dysfunction may result from increased preload, increased afterload, or decreased contractility. Causes of increased preload (volume overload) include regurgitation (mitral and aortic regurgitation), anemia, hyperthyroidism, and beriberi. Note that diseases with increased cardiac output, such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, and beriberi, are classified as high-output failure diseases. In contrast, diseases that decrease cardiac output are called low-output failure diseases. Causes of increased afterload (pressure overload) include hypertension, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Decreased contractility can result from myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, drugs, and certain infections. Diastolic dysfunction results from decreased filling of the ventricles during diastole. Examples of this include mitral stenosis, infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis, and constrictive pericardial diseases."

            ],
            correct: 0,
            explanation: "One of the consequences of myocardial ischemia is chest pain, which is called angina. Angina is caused by a mismatch between the myocardial oxygen demand and the myocardial blood flow. There are three main types of angina. Typical angina (stable angina) is the most common type and is characterized by pain that results from exercise, stress, or excitement. The pain is promptly relieved by rest (which decreases oxygen demand) or nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is converted to nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator that increases perfusion to the heart. ECG changes in patients with stable angina are nonspecific and include T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression, which occurs secondary to ischemia of the subendocardium of the left ventricle. The second type of angina, Prinzmetal’s angina (atypical angina), is caused by coronary artery vasospasm and is characterized by pain occurring at rest. This pain may be relieved by calcium channel blockers or nitroglycerin. ECG in these patients reveals ST-segment elevation, which is the result of transmural ischemia. The third type of angina is unstable angina, which is characterized by increasing frequency of pain, increased duration of pain, or pain that is produced by less physical exertion. This final type of angina indicates that a myocardial infarction (MI) may be near, most likely due to the formation of a thrombus over an area of coronary artery atherosclerosis. In contrast to an MI, with angina there is no actual necrosis (infarction) of myocardial tissue, and therefore there are no increased cardiac enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), in the serum. Also, the pain of angina is not made worse with deep inspiration, a sign that is suggestive of pleural disease."

              "Troponin"
            ],
            correct: 4,
            explanation: "The clinical diagnosis of MI depends on correlating clinical symptoms, ECG findings, and serum cardiac enzyme changes. The classic description of the pain produced by an MI is crushing, substernal pain that may radiate down the patient’s left arm. This pain may be associated with sweating, nausea, and vomiting. ECG findings associated with MI include ST-segment elevation (which may return to normal), inverted T waves, and abnormal Q waves. Serum enzymes that may be elevated after an MI include troponin, CPK, SGOT (AST), and LDH, which are increased temporally in that order. The troponin complex is made up of three protein subunits: troponin I (Tn-I), troponin T, and troponin C. There are three isoforms of Tn-I: two in skeletal muscle and one in cardiac muscle (cTn-I). cTn-I levels begin to increase 4 to 6 h after the onset of chest pain, reach maximal serum concentration in about 12 to 24 h, and remain elevated for about 3 to 10 days. CPK exists in three isoenzymes, MM, MB, and BB, where M stands for muscle and B stands for brain. Elevation of the CPK MB isoenzyme is seen following an MI. Levels begin to rise at 4 to 8 h, peak at 12 to 24 h, and return to normal in 3 to 4 days. LDH exists in five isoenzyme forms. Normally serum LDH2 is greater than LDH1, but following an MI this ratio is flipped, that is, LDH1 is greater than LDH2. LDH1 levels begin to rise at 10 to 12 h, peak at 2 to 3 days, and return to normal in 7 to 10 days. New cardiac markers use monoclonal antibodies directed against myoglobin, CK-MB mass assay, and cardiac troponin levels. Myoglobin is a small monomer with a rapid rise and fall in serum (narrow window) that may be used to test the effect of “clot-busting” drugs, especially with rapid serial detection."

Most cases of STEMI are caused by thrombosis of a coronary artery overlying a previously stable atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerosis, however, does not affect the coronary arteries equally. Generally atherosclerosis affects the proximal 2 cm of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex artery, and the proximal and distal one-third of the right coronary artery. Anterior infarcts (such as infarction of the anterior left ventricle) result from occlusion of the LAD, as this artery normally supplies the anterior left ventricle, the apex, and the anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum. About 10% of transmural myocardial infarcts (STEMIs) are not caused by thrombosis overlying an atherosclerotic plaque. Less frequent causes of MI in these cases include coronary artery vasospasm (sometimes seen in association with cocaine use), coronary artery embolism (possibly in association with atrial fibrillation), coronary arteritis, or deposition of amyloid in the walls of the coronary arteries."

            correct: 2,
            explanation: "Areas of myocardial infarction (MI) undergo a series of changes that consists of typical ischemic coagulative necrosis followed by inflammation and repair. MIs less than 6 to 12 h old are not apparent on gross examination. By 12 to 24 h, there is pallor in the area of infarction, which is due to the trapped blood. On days 1 to 3, grossly the infarct develops a hyperemic (red) border and then becomes pale yellow over the next several days (days 4 to 7). By 7 to 14 days, the area of necrosis is surrounded by a hyperemic red-purple border of highly vascularized granulation tissue. Over the next few weeks, the area of necrosis changes to a gray-white fibrotic scar. Electron microscopic (EM) changes in MI can be seen at 20 to 40 min, but routine histologic changes are first seen at 1 to 3 h. These EM findings consist of signs of reversible injury (mitochondrial swelling and distortion of cristae) and signs of irreversible injury (mitochondrial amorphous densities called flocculent densities). The earliest histologic change is the formation of wavy fibers. These wavy fibers result from the pulling of the noncontractile necrotic fibers by adjacent viable fibers. Histologic features of coagulation necrosis are seen at 12 to 24 h. An acute inflammatory response consisting mainly of neutrophils is most pronounced on days 2 to 3, while macrophages predominate during days 4 to 7. The ingrowth of highly vascularized granulation tissue begins around day 7 and is maximal at 2 to 4 weeks. Note that at about days 4 to 10 the infarcted tissue becomes quite soft, and there is a risk of cardiac rupture. These events within the first few weeks are followed by scarring (fibrosis), which is well developed by the sixth week and is irreversible."

            ],
            correct: 3,
            explanation: "Cardiac rupture, whether of free wall, septum, or papillary muscle, occurs in only 1% to 5% of cases following acute MI. It occurs usually within the first week of infarction, when there is maximal necrosis and softening (4 to 5 days) and is very rare after the second week. Rupture of the free wall results in pericardial hemorrhage and cardiac tamponade. Rupture of the interventricular septum causes a left-to-right shunt. Serious mitral valve incompetence results from rupture of anterior or posterior papillary muscles. This valve incompetence can produce signs of mitral regurgitation, including a new pansystolic murmur along with a diastolic flow murmur. Indeed, the onset of a new murmur following a MI should raise the possibility of papillary rupture. Other common complications of MI include arrhythmias such as heart block, sinus arrhythmias, or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. These occur in 90% of complicated cases. Next in importance, but not in frequency (only 10%), is cardiogenic shock from severe left ventricular contractile incompetence. Milder left ventricular failure with lung edema occurs in 60% of these cases, while mural thrombosis with peripheral emboli may occur in up to 40%. Ventricular aneurysm forms a “bulge” of the left ventricular chamber; it consists of scar tissue and does not rupture, but may contain a thrombus.

            explanation: "Cardiac rupture is most frequent at 4 to 7 days post-MI, while fibrinous pericarditis usually develops around day 2 to 3. Pericarditis that develops approximately 1 to 3 weeks following an MI is called Dressler’s syndrome. This is an autoimmune disorder. Pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardium. Patients develop severe retrosternal chest pain that is typically worse with deep inspiration or coughing. Physical examination reveals the characteristic pericardial friction rub. ECG changes and pulsus paradoxus are also present. Pericarditis developing after a myocardial infarct is usually either serous or serofibrinous. Serous pericarditis contains few inflammatory cells and may also result from uremia or autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Serofibrinous pericarditis has a fibrinous exudate mixed with the serous fluid and may result from uremia or viral infections. Other types of pericarditis include purulent (suppurative) pericarditis with many inflammatory cells (seen with bacterial infections) or hemorrhagic pericarditis (seen with carcinoma or tuberculosis)."

Systemic HHD is the result of systemic hypertension, which causes left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. There is by definition no other cardiac disease present that could cause LV hypertrophy, such as aortic stenosis. Hypertension is a pressure overload on the heart, and as such it causes concentric LV hypertrophy without dilation. This type of hypertrophy is characterized by a parallel deposition of sarcomeres. Histologic sections may show myocytes with hyperchromatic and rectangular (“box-car”) nuclei. In contrast, eccentric hypertrophy is the result of volume overload on the heart. In systemic HHD the LV is stiff, as there is decreased LV compliance. Pulmonary HHD refers to right ventricular hypertrophy that is the result of pulmonary disease. By definition, this type of heart disease is called cor pulmonale. Pulmonary diseases that can cause cor pulmonale include diseases of the lung parenchyma, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial fibrosis, and diseases of the pulmonary vessels, such as multiple pulmonary emboli and pulmonary vascular sclerosis.

            explanation: "Aortic stenosis (AS) is usually the result of a bicuspid aortic valve (AV), degenerative calcification of a bicuspid valve, or rheumatic heart disease. Patients with aortic stenosis may present with angina (chest pain), syncopal episodes with exertion, and heart failure. Angina results from the mismatch between increased oxygen demand of the hypertrophied left ventricle (LV) and decreased blood flow, while syncope results from the inability to increase stroke volume as necessary with a stenotic AV. AS is the most common valvular disease that is associated with angina and syncope. The characteristic heart murmur of AS is a crescendo-decrescendo midsystolic ejection murmur that has a paradoxically split S2. In order to pump the blood into the aorta across a stenotic AV, the pressure in the LV must be much greater than the resultant pressure in the aorta. In order to produce this increased pressure, the LV undergoes concentric hypertrophy, which increases contractility. This concentric hypertrophy also makes the wall of the LV stiffer (decreased compliance). This stiff LV is unable to dilate until the time the LV starts to fail."

            explanation: "Clinical manifestations of aortic regurgitation (AR) include exertional dyspnea, angina, and left ventricular failure. Owing to the rapidly falling arterial pressure during late systole and diastole, there is often wide pulse pressure, Corrigan’s “water-hammer” pulse, capillary pulsations at the nail beds, and a pistol-shot sound over the femoral arteries. A blowing diastolic murmur is heard along the left sternal border. Volume overload of the heart is the basic defect and results in left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy. AR is rheumatic in origin in approximately 70% of cases. Much less frequently it is due to syphilis, ankylosing spondylitis (rarely), infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, or aortic dilation from cystic medial necrosis. Congenital forms of aortic stenosis occur fairly frequently, but AR is rarely congenital in origin."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "The normal mitral valve (MV) is a bicuspid valve with the anterior cusp approximately twice the area of the posterior cusp. The MV area is normally 5 to 6 cm². Clinically significant mitral stenosis (MS) usually results when the valve area decreases to less than 1 cm². MS most commonly develops as a consequence of rheumatic heart disease. It may also develop due to congenital abnormalities or calcium deposition. In patients with MS there is decreased flow across the MV due to the stenosis of the valve. In order to move the blood into the left ventricle (LV), the left atrial (LA) pressure during diastole is greater than normal and greater than the LV pressure. Instead of producing changes in the LV, MS causes the left atrium to hypertrophy and dilate. These changes predispose patients with MS to arrhythmias (which are felt as palpitations) and to the development of LA thrombi (which may lead to systemic emboli). The hypertrophied left atrium may also compress the esophagus (resulting in dysphagia) or irritate the recurrent laryngeal nerve (producing hoarseness). The increased LA pressure also causes a mid-diastolic murmur and can be reflected back into the lungs and to the right ventricle. In the lungs this produces venous congestion and hemorrhage, which cause dyspnea, fatigue, and hemoptysis."

            explanation: "Rheumatic fever (RF) is a systemic autoimmune disease that usually develops 10 days to 6 weeks after a pharyngeal infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. This autoimmune disorder results from cross-reactions between cardiac antigens and antibodies evoked by one of the many streptococcal antigens, e.g., streptococcal M protein. Rheumatic fever produces both acute and chronic manifestations. The major findings of acute RF include migratory polyarthritis of large joints, carditis, erythema marginatum of skin (although skin involvement is not very common), subcutaneous nodules, and Sydenham chorea. The acute cardiac lesions of rheumatic fever (carditis) are characterized by the accumulation of modified tissue monocytes (called Anitschkow myocytes) around areas of fibrinoid necrosis. This entire area is called an Aschoff body. The nuclei of the Anitschkow cells are long, slender, wavy ribbons that resemble a caterpillar (hence the name “caterpillar cells”). Occasional multinucleated giant cells (Aschoff cells) may be seen. The Aschoff body, which is pathognomonic for acute rheumatic fever, may be found in any of the three layers of the heart (pancarditis). In the pericardium, there is a fibrinous pericarditis, which is called a “bread and butter” pericarditis. The endocardial response in acute rheumatic fever is characterized by the formation of small friable vegetations (verrucae) along the lines of closure of the valves. In contrast, chronic RF mainly produces damage to cardiac valves. The mitral valve is most commonly involved, followed by the aortic valve. The stenotic valve has the appearance of a “fish mouth” or “buttonhole.” An additional finding in chronic RF is a rough portion of the endocardium of the left atrium, called a MacCallum’s patch."

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or dysplasia (ARVD) is a disorder characterized by an abnormal right ventricle that is dilated and has a thin wall that has been replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. Complications of ARVD include exercise-induced arrhythmias and sudden death. Some cases are related to mutations in the genes coding for either plakoglobin, desmoplakin (DSP), or plakophilin-2 (PKP2). Naxos syndrome (so named because it occurs only on the Greek island Naxos) is a similar disorder that is also associated with abnormalities of the gene coding for plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), an intracellular protein that links adhesion molecules in desmosomes to desmin. The clinical signs of Naxos syndrome are similar to arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, but hyperkeratoses of the plantar and palmar skin are also present. Endocardial fibrosis (EF) and Loeffler endomyocarditis (LEM) are two types of restrictive cardiomyopathies that are also associated with fibrosis of the ventricular endocardium. EF is primarily a disease of children and younger adults in tropical areas, while LEM is not restricted to these areas. In addition, LEM is often associated with an eosinophilic leukemia. It is thought that the release of major basic protein from these neoplastic eosinophils initiates the endocardial damage that leads to fibrosis."

            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Infective endocarditis is the result of microorganisms growing on any of the heart valves. These organisms may have either high virulence or low virulence. Highly virulent organisms, such as S. aureus and group A streptococci, infect previously normal valves and produce severe symptoms within 6 weeks. This abnormality is referred to as acute bacterial endocarditis. In contrast, organisms of low virulence, such as α-hemolytic viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis, infect previously damaged valves, such as valves damaged by rheumatic fever. These organisms produce symptoms that last longer than 6 weeks. This abnormality is referred to as subacute bacterial endocarditis. Infective endocarditis in IV drug abusers, which normally occurs on the tricuspid valve, is caused by S. aureus, group A streptococci, Candida species, and gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas species. Symptoms in patients with infective endocarditis are the result of bacteremia, emboli from the vegetations, immune complexes, and valvular disease. Bacteremia produces fever, positive blood cultures (several of which may be needed for confirmation), abscesses, and osteomyelitis. Embolization of parts of the large, friable vegetations can produce Roth spots in the retina, splinter hemorrhages in nail beds, and infarcts of the brain, heart, and spleen. Splenic infarcts produce left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain. Immune complexes can deposit in multiple areas of the body and cause glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, tender nodules in the fingers and toes (Osler’s nodes), and red papules in the palms and soles (Janeway lesions). Valvular disease can also result in perforation and valvular regurgitation."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Inflammation of the myocardium (myocarditis) has numerous causes, but most of the well-documented cases of myocarditis are of viral origin. The most common viral causes are coxsackieviruses A and B, echovirus, and influenza virus. Patients usually develop symptoms a few weeks after a viral infection. Most patients recover from the acute myocarditis, but a few may die from congestive heart failure or arrhythmias. Sections of the heart show patchy or diffuse interstitial infiltrates composed of T lymphocytes and macrophages. There may be focal or patchy acute myocardial necrosis. Bacterial infections of the myocardium produce multiple foci of inflammation composed mainly of neutrophils. Giant cell myocarditis, which was previously called Fiedler’s myocarditis, is characterized by granulomatous inflammation with giant cells and is usually rapidly fatal. In hypersensitivity myocarditis, which is caused by hypersensitivity reactions to several drugs, the inflammatory infiltrate includes many eosinophils, and the infiltrate is both interstitial and perivascular. Beriberi, one of the metabolic diseases of the heart, is a cause of high-output failure and is characterized by decreased peripheral vascular resistance and increased cardiac output. Patients have dilated hearts, but the microscopic changes are nonspecific. Hyperthyroid disease and Paget’s disease are other causes of high-output failure."

            explanation: "Plaques or vegetations are found in characteristic locations within the heart in several different disorders. Vegetations can occur in acute rheumatic fever as small masses found in a row along the lines of closure of the valves. In contrast, the vegetations of infective endocarditis are large, irregular masses that extend beyond the valves onto the chordae. Nonbacterial thrombotic (marantic) endocarditis, which is associated with prolonged debilitating diseases and cachexia, may produce one or two small, sterile vegetations at the line of valve closure. In patients with SLE, medium-sized vegetations (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) may occur on either or both sides of the valve leaflets, typically on the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve. The development of Libman-Sacks endocarditis is associated with the presence of the lupus anticoagulant (antiphospholipid syndrome), an antibody that makes platelets “sticky” and increases the chance of thrombosis."

            ],
            correct: 4,
            explanation: "White plaques involving the right side of the heart are associated with the carcinoid syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by episodic flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and cyanosis. These symptoms are caused by the release of vasoactive amines, such as serotonin, from carcinoid tumors. These substances are inactivated by enzymes such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the liver, lung, and brain. MAO-A degrades norepinephrine and serotonin, while MAO-B degrades dopamine. Cardiac symptoms are found in patients with liver metastases, which bypass the inactivation by the liver itself. The cardiac lesions producing carcinoid heart disease are found on the right side of the heart because these active metabolites are inactivated in the lung. The cardiac lesions consist of fibrous plaques found on the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. Microscopic sections of these plaques reveal smooth muscle cells and sparse collagen fibers in an acid mucopolysaccharide matrix. Similar lesions can develop with the use of certain diet suppressants or with ergotamine therapy for migraine headaches. Diet suppressants associated with these lesions include dexfenfluramine (Redux) and Fen-Phen (fenfluramine and phentermine). Redux increases serotonin levels by increasing release and decreasing uptake of serotonin in the central nervous system (CNS), supposedly increasing satiety. Phentermine decreases the appetite center in the brain by increasing norepinephrine levels through increased release and decreased uptake. In contrast to carcinoid heart disease, plaques in the left atrium are seen in chronic rheumatic heart disease and are called MacCallum’s patches. Vegetations also occur in rheumatic heart disease; these are small and are found in a row along the lines of closure of the valves. Amyloid deposits may be found in the heart secondary to multiple myeloma or as an isolated event, such as in senile cardiac amyloidosis. Grossly the walls of the heart may be thickened, and there may be multiple small nodules on the left atrial endocardial surface. Iron overload can affect the heart as a result of hereditary hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis. Grossly the heart is a rust-brown color and resembles the heart in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In hypothyroidism the heart is characteristically flabby, enlarged, and dilated, which results in decreased cardiac output. This reduced circulation results in cold sensitivity. Histologically there is an interstitial mucopolysaccharide edema fluid within the heart."

            explanation: "The cardiomyopathies (CMPs) may be classified into primary and secondary forms. The primary forms are mainly idiopathic (unknown cause). Most of the secondary cardiomyopathies result in a dilated cardiomyopathy that is characterized by congestion and four-chamber dilation with hypertrophy. The walls are either of normal thickness or they may be thinner than normal. This results in a flabby, globular, banana-shaped heart that is hypocontracting. The microscopic appearance is not distinctive. The ventricles may contain mural thrombi. The causes of secondary dilated CMP are many and include alcoholism (the most common cause in the United States), metabolic disorders, and toxins. Examples of the latter include cobalt, which has been used in beer as a foam stabilizer; anthracyclines; cocaine; and iron, the deposition of which is seen in patients with hemochromatosis. The anthracycline Adriamycin, which is used in chemotherapy, causes lipid peroxidation of myofiber membranes. One final form of DCM develops in the last trimester of pregnancy or the first 6 months after delivery. About half of these patients recover full cardiac function. Other forms of cardiomyopathies include a hypertrophic form, a restrictive form, and an obliterative form. In hypertrophic CMP the major gross abnormality is within the interventricular septum, which is usually thicker than the left ventricle. Constrictive (restrictive) CMP is associated with amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, endomyocardial disease, or storage diseases. These abnormalities produce a stiff, hypocontracting heart."

Primary tumors of the heart are quite rare; the most common in the adult is the myxoma. These tumors occur most often in the left atrium, and if pedunculated they may interfere with the mitral valve by a “ball valve” effect. Histologically they are composed of stellate cells in a loose myxoid background.

They are classified according to their location (membranous, infundibular, muscular) or to their size (large, medium, small). Small VSDs (<0.5 cm in diameter) are common and are usually located in the muscular septum. This type of defect, called Roger’s disease, produces a loud pansystolic murmur but causes little functional disturbance. These defects tend to close as the heart enlarges or the muscle hypertrophies. The clinical effects produced by VSDs range in severity according to the volume of blood that crosses the shunt. Patients with severe cases die secondary to left-sided congestive failure, while smaller shunts increase the risk for endocarditis. Classic signs of a VSD include dyspnea, poor growth (no cyanosis), and a pansystolic murmur over the left lower sternal border with biventricular hypertrophy. VSDs initially involve a left-to-right shunt, from the higher-pressure left side to the lower-pressure right side. This type of shunt, also seen with atrial septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and persistent truncus arteriosus, is initially acyanotic.

            explanation: "Left-to-right congenital shunts are not initially cyanotic, but cyanosis may develop later (tardive cyanosis) if the shunt shifts to a right-to-left shunt due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (Eisenmenger’s complex). Atrial septal defects (ASDs) illustrate this pathophysiologic effect well. The shunt with an ASD is initially left-to-right: left atrium to right atrium to right ventricle to lungs to left atrium. Cyanosis does not occur until later, when the shunt reverses, becoming right-to-left. This occurs because with time the pulmonary vessels become hyperplastic and irreversible pulmonary hypertension develops due to the volume overload to the lungs. The blood flow with an ASD that has reversed due to Eisenmenger’s complex is right atrium to left atrium (right-to-left) to left ventricle to aorta and then back to right atrium. An ASD with elevated pulmonary pressures allows emboli to enter the systemic circulation directly (paradoxical embolus). ASDs are the most common type of congenital heart disease that presents in adults; these individuals develop palpitations, exertional dyspnea, systolic flow murmurs, widely split fixed S2, and right axis deviation."

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "As the endocardial cushions join to divide the ventricles, the streams of blood from the right and left ventricles are divided as they flow out of the truncus. A spiral septum develops to physically separate the two streams of blood. The fusion of the spiral ridges results in division of the truncus into the pulmonary and aortic arteries. Occasionally the spiral is reversed, resulting in the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left. This is a complete transposition of the great vessels and produces two completely separate blood systems. This situation is incompatible with life unless some type of mixing of blood can occur between these separate systems. In utero, mixing of blood occurs across the atrial septum and via the placental circulation. Cases that survive to corrective surgery must have a persistent atrial septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus to allow mixing of blood. Therefore, the clinical goal is to keep the ductus arteriosus open. Normally, at birth, breathing decreases pulmonary resistance, reversing flow through the ductus arteriosus. This oxygenated blood (flowing from the aorta into the ductus) inhibits prostaglandin production, which closes the ductus arteriosus. To keep it open, prostaglandin E2 should be administered."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Increased intracranial pressure can result from mass lesions in the brain, cerebral edema, or hydrocephalus. It can cause swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema), headaches, vomiting, or herniation of part of the brain into the foramen magnum or under a free part of the dura. Brain herniations are classified according to the area of the brain that is herniated. Subfalcine herniations are caused by herniation of the medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere (cingulate gyrus) under the falx, which may compress the anterior cerebral artery. Transtentorial herniation, which occurs when the medial part of the temporal lobe (uncus) herniates over the free edge of the tentorium, may result in compression of the oculomotor nerve, causing pupillary dilation and ophthalmoplegia (the affected eye points “down and out”). Tentorial herniation may also compress the cerebral peduncles, within which are the pyramidal tracts. Ipsilateral compression produces contralateral motor paralysis (hemiparesis), while compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against Kernohan’s notch causes ipsilateral hemiparesis. Further caudal displacement of the entire brainstem may cause tearing of the penetrating arteries of the midbrain (Duret hemorrhages). This caudal displacement may also stretch the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve VI), causing paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle (the abnormal eye turns inward). Masses in the cerebellum may cause tonsillar herniation, in which the cerebellar tonsils are herniated into the foramen magnum. This may compress the medulla and respiratory centers, causing death. Tonsillar herniation may also occur if a lumbar puncture is performed in a patient with increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, before performing an LP, check the patient for papilledema."

The Arnold-Chiari malformation consists of herniation of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle into the foramen magnum, flattening of the base of the skull, and spina bifida with meningomyelocele. Newborns with this disorder are at risk of developing hydrocephalus within the first few days of delivery secondary to stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct. In contrast, severe hypoplasia or absence of the cerebellar vermis occurs in the Dandy-Walker malformation. There is cystic distention of the roof of the fourth ventricle, hydrocephalus, and possibly agenesis of the corpus callosum. Tuberous sclerosis may show characteristic firm, white nodules (tubers) in the cortex and subependymal nodules of gliosis protruding into the ventricles (“candle drippings”). Other signs of tuberous sclerosis include the triad of seizures, mental retardation, and congenital white spots or macules (leukoderma). Facial angiofibromata (adenoma sebaceum) may also occur. In von Hippel-Lindau disease, multiple benign and malignant neoplasms occur, including hemangioblastomas of the retina, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata; angiomas of the kidney and liver; and renal cell carcinomas. Patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a nonfamilial congenital disorder, display angiomas of the brain, leptomeninges, and ipsilateral face, which are called port-wine stains (nevus flammeus)."

            explanation: "Neural tube developmental defects are caused by defective closure of the neural tube. These defects, which may occur anywhere along the extent of the neural tube, are classified as either caudal or cranial defects. Failure of development of the cranial end of the neural tube results in anencephaly, while failure of development of the caudal end results in spina bifida. Anencephaly, which is not compatible with life, is characterized by the absence of the forebrain, replaced by disorganized glial tissue with vessels (cerebrovasculosa). Ultrasound will reveal an abnormal head shape with absence of the skull. Neural tube defects are associated with increased maternal serum α-fetoprotein (AFP), a glycoprotein synthesized by the yolk sac and fetal liver. Increased AFP is also seen in yolk sac tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma; decreased AFP is associated with Down syndrome. Risk factors include maternal obesity and decreased folate during pregnancy. Folate supplementation reduces the incidence of these defects."

            explanation: "Epidural hemorrhages occur in the potential space between the dura and the skull, usually after severe trauma causing a skull fracture. They result from rupture of a meningeal artery, most often the middle meningeal artery (branch of the maxillary artery), as the fracture is typically in the temporal area. Because the bleeding is arterial (high pressure), it is rapid, but patients may have a lucid interval before deterioration. The expanding hematoma increases intracranial pressure, which can lead to tentorial herniation and death."

            explanation: "Subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is much less common than hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, most often results from the rupture of a berry aneurysm. These aneurysms are saccular aneurysms that result from congenital defects in the media of arteries and are typically located at the bifurcations of arteries. They are not the result of atherosclerosis. Berry aneurysms are most commonly found in the circle of Willis, typically at the junction of the anterior communicating artery with the anterior cerebral artery or at the junction of the middle cerebral artery and the posterior communicating artery. The chance of rupture increases with age. Rupture causes bleeding into the subarachnoid space and produces severe headaches (“worst headache ever”), vomiting, and neck stiffness due to meningeal irritation.

Gross changes include watershed infarcts at the border zones between major cerebral arteries and laminar necrosis related to short, penetrating vessels from pial arteries. The earliest histologic changes, within the first 24 hours, include the formation of red neurons (acute neuronal injury), characterized by cytoplasmic eosinophilia, pyknosis, and karyorrhexis. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and the pyramidal neurons of Sommer’s sector in the hippocampus are particularly sensitive to ischemic damage and are most likely to demonstrate these early changes.

While there are many causes, the combination of alien hand, extrapyramidal rigidity, sensory cortical dysfunction, and tau-positive inclusions in astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and neurons is most suggestive of corticobasal degeneration. Cortical dysfunction in this syndrome includes language disorders and apraxia. Damage to the dominant parietal lobe can produce apraxia and Gerstmann’s syndrome (right-left confusion, finger agnosia, agraphia, dyscalculia). Déjérine-Roussy syndrome involves contralateral sensory loss with dysthesia; Parinaud’s syndrome involves impaired vertical gaze and pupillary abnormalities from upper midbrain compression; Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome) results from vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery occlusion."

            explanation: "Hypertension is a common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and promotes atherosclerosis in smaller distal branches of vessels. It also causes lipohyalinosis—lipid and hyaline deposition in cerebral arteriole walls—which weakens the wall and leads to small Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms that may rupture. Hypertensive hemorrhages often involve the lenticulostriate arteries (branches of the middle cerebral artery), producing lacunar or large hemorrhages in the corpus striatum, putamen, and internal capsule. They also occur in the cerebellum and pons and are often fatal.

            explanation: "In primary CNS demyelination there is loss of myelin sheaths with relative preservation of axons. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause, producing disseminated but focal plaques of primary demyelination anywhere in the CNS, often in the white matter near the angles of the lateral ventricles. It typically affects young adults between 20 and 40 years of age and follows a remitting-relapsing course. Symptoms include visual abnormalities, tremors, paresthesias, and incoordination. The classic Charcot triad is scanning speech, intention tremor, and nystagmus (mnemonic: SIN). Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), or MLF syndrome, is pathognomonic for MS and results from demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, causing medial rectus palsy on attempted lateral gaze and monocular nystagmus in the abducting eye with preserved convergence. CSF findings include increased T lymphocytes, increased protein, and normal glucose; oligoclonal bands may be present."

It presents with a combination of lower motor neuron signs (weakness, fasciculations, atrophy) and upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) without sensory loss. Early symptoms include weakness and cramping, progressing to atrophy and fasciculations. The triad of atrophic weakness of hands and forearms, slight spasticity of the legs, and generalized hyperreflexia in the absence of sensory changes is characteristic. The course is rapid, with death often from respiratory complications. Etiologies include oxidative stress from defective zinc-copper superoxide dismutase (SOD1) on chromosome 21.

It is characterized histologically by neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques with central amyloid cores. The amyloid is derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP). Cleavage of beta-APP by alpha-secretase prevents beta-amyloid formation, but cleavage by beta-secretase (BACE-1) or gamma-secretase generates fragments that aggregate into pathogenic amyloid fibrils. Beta-amyloid deposition is necessary but not sufficient for AD development. Early-onset familial AD is linked to mutations in presenilin 1 (chromosome 14) and presenilin 2 (chromosome 1)."

It is often caused by pineal region tumors, which may be germ cell tumors such as germinomas, teratomas, or embryonal carcinomas. Pineoblastomas occur in younger patients and are aggressive, while pineocytomas occur in older adults and are slow-growing.

This disrupts decussating fibers of the spinothalamic tract, producing segmental sensory loss in a 'cape-like' distribution. The most common site is the cervical cord, so MRI of the cervical spine is the best diagnostic test. Syringomyelia may also cause intrinsic hand muscle wasting and scoliosis, and can be associated with Chiari malformations."

            explanation: "Complete ipsilateral facial paralysis involving both upper and lower facial muscles indicates a lower motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve (CN VII). Lesions distal to the facial nucleus, such as in Bell’s palsy, cause inability to close the eye, loss of nasolabial fold, and drooping of the mouth on the affected side. Bell’s phenomenon (upward and outward rotation of the eye on attempted closure) and excessive tearing ('crocodile tears') may be present.

Low plasma levels of TSH would result in atrophy of the thyroid gland. In a person with Graves’ disease, the same changes in plasma levels of T4 and TSH would be present, but the thyroid gland would not be atrophied.

High plasma levels of TSH indicate inappropriately low levels of free thyroid hormones in the circulation, such as are present with autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland in persons with Hashimoto’s disease. However, because elevated plasma levels of estrogen in pregnancy increase hepatic production of TBG, the total amount (bound + free) of thyroid hormones in the circulation is elevated.

Even though prolactin levels are increased 10- to 20-fold at the end of pregnancy, the suppressive effects of estrogen and progesterone prevent milk production until after the baby is born. Immediately after birth, the sudden loss of both estrogen and progesterone secretion from the placenta allows the lactogenic effect of prolactin to promote milk production."

Protein-bound T4 is biologically inactive. Circulating T4 is highly bound to plasma proteins, especially to TBG, which increases during pregnancy. An increase in TBG tends to decrease free T4, which then leads to an increase in TSH secretion, causing the thyroid to increase thyroid hormone secretion. Increased secretion of thyroid hormones persists until free T4 returns to normal levels, at which time there is no longer a stimulus for increased TSH secretion. Therefore, in a chronic steady-state condition associated with elevated TBG, high plasma total T4 (bound and free) and normal plasma TSH levels would be expected. In this pregnant patient, the normal levels of total T4, along with high plasma levels of TSH, would indicate an inappropriately low plasma level of free T4. Deficient thyroid hormone secretion in this patient would be consistent with Hashimoto’s disease, the most common form of hypothyroidism."

Because of the tendency for plasma glucose to increase, there is a compensatory increase in insulin secretion, including C-peptide, which is part of the insulin prohormone. Hypovolemia and increased production of ketone bodies, although commonly associated with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, are not typically present in the early stages of type 2 diabetes."

Thirst does not directly increase ADH secretion."

            "explanation": "The man’s urine osmolarity is very dilute, while his serum osmolarity is increased. In the face of increased serum osmolarity, there should be increased ADH secretion, which should then act on the collecting duct principal cells to increase water reabsorption and concentrate the urine. The fact that the urine is dilute, not concentrated, suggests that ADH either is absent (central diabetes insipidus) or is ineffective (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Administration of an exogenous ADH analogue separates these two possibilities—it was ineffective in changing serum or urine osmolarity; thus, it can be concluded that ADH unable to act on the collecting ducts, that is, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. One cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is hypercalcemia, which is present in this patent secondary to his lung cancer; he likely has humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, due to secretion of PTH-rp by the tumor. Dehydration would cause increased ADH secretion and increased urine osmolarity. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH would cause increased urine osmolarity and subsequently decreased serum osmolarity, due to excess water reabsorption."

PTH-rp has all of the actions of PTH, including increased bone resorption, increased renal Ca2+ reabsorption, and decreased renal phosphate reabsorption; all of these actions lead to increased serum Ca2+ concentration. The treatment should be directed at lowering serum Ca2+ concentration, which can be achieved by giving an inhibitor of bone resorption (e.g., pamidronate) and an inhibitor of renal Ca2+ reabsorption (furosemide). Giving an ADH antagonist would be ineffective because the man’s nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has made his collecting ducts insensitive to ADH. Giving half-normal saline could lower his serum osmolarity temporarily, but would not address the underlying problem of hypercalcemia."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Complete deficiency causes salt-wasting adrenogenitalism with absent mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid synthesis, leading to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, hypotension, and increased ACTH-driven adrenal hyperplasia. Excess precursors are shunted to androgen production, causing virilization in XX infants (pseudohermaphroditism). Partial deficiency causes milder cortisol/aldosterone deficiency without salt wasting but still results in androgen excess."

      "Treatment with acetylcholine",
      "Exhalation to residual volume"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A decrease in airway resistance is due to an increase in the diameter of the airway. Asthma causes bronchoconstriction, which is prevented by β-agonists. Sympathetic stimulation of the airways results in a relaxation of airways, decreasing resistance. Acetylcholine is a bronchoconstrictor, increasing resistance. With low lung volumes there is a collapse of the airways, leading to decreased diameter and increased resistance."

    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "The pleural pressure (sometimes called the intrapleural pressure) is the pressure of the fluid in the narrow space between the visceral pleura of the lungs and parietal pleura of the chest wall. The pleural pressure is normally about -5 cm H₂O immediately before inspiration (i.e., at FRC) when all of the respiratory muscles are relaxed. During inspiration, the volume of the chest cavity increases and the pleural pressure becomes more negative. The pleural pressure averages about -7.5 cm H₂O immediately before expiration when the lungs are fully expanded."

      "Scaleni",
      "Sternocleidomastoid muscles"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Contraction of the internal intercostals and abdominal recti pull the rib cage downward during expiration. The abdominal recti and other abdominal muscles compress the abdominal contents upward toward the diaphragm, which also helps to eliminate air from the lungs. The diaphragm relaxes during expiration. The external intercostals, sternocleidomastoid muscles, and scaleni increase the diameter of the chest cavity during exercise and thus assist with inspiration, but only the diaphragm is necessary for inspiration during quiet breathing."

    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Stimulation of parasympathetic nerves results in a bronchoconstriction. With low lung volumes a collapse of the airways occurs, leading to decreased diameter and increased resistance. Histamine is a bronchoconstrictor. Forced exhalations will increase pleural pressure, decreasing airway diameter, and thus increasing resistance. All the responses are correct."

      "Increased pumping of lymphatics",
      "Increase in the concentration of interstitial proteins"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A slow increase in left heart function will lead to a gradual increase in pulmonary capillary pressure, and thus greater fluid filtration. Over time there will be an increase in lymphatics and lymphatic pumping to remove the fluid from the interstitial space. With heart failure there is an increase in fluid retention, and thus no decrease in plasma protein concentration. An increase in interstitial hydrostatic pressure will result in an increase in edema."

      "Alveolar Surface Tension: No change, Pulmonary Compliance: No change"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Surfactant is formed relatively late in fetal life. Premature babies born without adequate amounts of surfactant can develop pulmonary failure and die. Surfactant is a surface active agent that greatly reduces the surface tension of the water lining the alveoli. By reducing the surface tension of the water lining the alveoli, the surfactant reduces the work of breathing—that is, less transpulmonary pressure is required to inhale a given volume of air. Because compliance is equal to the change in lung volume for a given change in transpulmonary pressure, it should be clear that pulmonary compliance is decreased in the absence of surfactant."

    "question": "What happens during exercise?",
    "options": [
      "Blood flow is uniform throughout the lung",
      "Lung-diffusing capacity increases because blood flow is continuous in all pulmonary capillaries",
      "Pulmonary blood volume decreases",
      "The transit time of blood in the pulmonary capillaries does not change from rest"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Blood flow during exercise is still higher at the base of the lung compared with the apex due to gravity. During exercise there is an opening of more blood vessels in the lung, and thus better perfusion. With the opening of more blood vessels an increase in diffusing capacity occurs, allowing equilibration of the blood with O₂ in spite of the increase in flow. Due to the opening of unperfused vessels and vasodilation of existing vessels, there would be no decrease in lung blood volume. With an increase in cardiac output there will be a decrease in transit time; however, the blood is still equilibrated."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man sustains a bullet wound to the chest that causes a pneumothorax. What best describes the changes in lung volume and thoracic volume in this man compared with normal?",
    "options": [

      "Lung Volume: Increased, Thoracic Volume: Increased",
      "Lung Volume: Increased, Thoracic Volume: No change"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Both the lung and thoracic cage are elastic. Under normal conditions, the elastic tendency of the lungs to collapse is exactly balanced by the elastic tendency of the thoracic cage to expand. When air is introduced into the pleural space, the pleural pressure becomes equal to atmospheric pressure—the chest wall springs outward and the lungs collapse."

    "question": "A healthy 10-year-old boy breathes quietly under resting conditions. His tidal volume is 400 milliliters and his ventilation frequency is 12/min. Which of the following best describes the ventilation of the upper, middle, and lower lung zones in this boy?",
    "options": [
      "Upper Zone: Highest, Middle Zone: Lowest, Lower Zone: Intermediate",
      "Upper Zone: Highest, Middle Zone: Intermediate, Lower Zone: Lowest",

      "Upper Zone: Lowest, Middle Zone: Intermediate, Lower Zone: Highest",
      "Upper Zone: Same, Middle Zone: Same, Lower Zone: Same"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The lower zones of the lung ventilate better than the upper zones, and the middle zones have intermediate ventilation. These differences in regional ventilation can be explained by regional differences in pleural pressure. The pleural pressure is typically about -10 cm H₂O in the upper regions and about -2.5 cm H₂O in the lower regions. A less negative pleural pressure in the lower regions of the chest cavity causes less expansion of the lower zones of the lung during resting conditions. Therefore, the bottom of the lung is relatively compressed during rest but expands better during inspiration compared with the apex."

    "question": "A person with normal lungs has an oxygen (O₂) consumption of 750 ml O₂/min. The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration is 15 g/dl. The mixed venous saturation is 25%. What is the cardiac output?",
    "options": [
      "2500 ml/min",
      "5000 ml/min",
      "7500 ml/min",
      "10,000 ml/min",
      "20,000 ml/min"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Arterial content = 15 g/dl × 1.34 ml O₂/gm Hb = 20 ml O₂/dl (1 dl = 100 ml). Venous saturation is 25%, so venous content is 20 ml O₂/dl × 0.25 = 5 ml O₂/dl. Fick's principal is O₂ consumption = cardiac output (arterial content – venous content). 750 ml O₂/min = cardiac output × (20 ml O₂/dl – 5 ml O₂/dl). Cardiac output = (750 ml O₂/min)/(15 ml O₂/dl) = 5000 ml/min."

    "options": [
      "Ductus arteriosus",
      "Foramen ovale",
      "Left atrium",
      "Pulmonary artery",
      "Right atrium"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Ductus arteriosus is present in a fetus, not a healthy adult, in the segment that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta. Either this is not present in an adult or the pressures would be higher than measured because this is connected to the aorta. The foramen ovale is a cardiac shunt in the fetal heart from right atrium to left atrium, so pressures would be very low. The left atrial pressure should be between 1 and 5 mm Hg. The pulmonary artery pressure ranges from 25 systolic to ~12 to 14 mm Hg diastolic. The right atrial pressure is ~0 to 2 mm Hg."

      "25% decrease",
      "50% decrease",
      "75% decrease"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Fick's law of diffusion states that Diffusion = (Pressure gradient × Surface area × Solubility)/(Distance × MW²). To simplify, make everything have a value of 1 so diffusion = 1. Now decrease surface area to 0.5 (50% decrease) and double distance to 2. Then diffusion = (1 × 0.5 × 1)/(2 × 1) = 0.25. Thus, the answer is 0.25, which is a 75% decrease from normal."

      "Flow: Same, Resistance: Lower, Arterial Pressure: Lower"
    ],
    "correct": 5,
    "explanation": "The pulmonary and systemic circulations both receive about the same amount of blood flow because the lungs receive the entire cardiac output. The pulmonary blood vessels have a relatively low resistance, allowing the entire cardiac output to pass through them without increasing the pressure to a great extent. The pulmonary artery pressure averages about 15 mm Hg, which is much lower than the systemic arterial pressure of about 100 mm Hg."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man is admitted emergently to the hospital because of severe chest pain. A Swan-Ganz catheter is floated into the pulmonary artery, the balloon is inflated, and the pulmonary wedge pressure is measured. The pulmonary wedge pressure is used clinically to monitor which pressure?",
    "options": [

      "Left ventricular pressure",
      "Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure",
      "Pulmonary artery systolic pressure",
      "Pulmonary capillary pressure"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "It is usually not feasible to measure the left atrial pressure directly in a normal human being because it is difficult to pass a catheter through the heart chambers into the left atrium. The balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheter (Swan-Ganz catheter) was developed to estimate left atrial pressure. When the balloon is inflated on a Swan-Ganz catheter, the pressure measured through the catheter, called the wedge pressure, approximates the left atrial pressure for the following reason: blood flow distal to the catheter tip has been stopped all the way to the left atrium, which allows left atrial pressure to be estimated."

      "Lymph Flow: Increase, Plasma Colloid Osmotic Pressure: Increase, Pulmonary Capillary Permeability: Increase"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A P. aeruginosa infection can increase the capillary permeability in the lungs and elsewhere in the body, which leads to excess loss of plasma proteins into the interstitial spaces. This leakage of plasma proteins from the vasculature caused the plasma colloid osmotic pressure to decrease from a normal value of about 28 mm Hg to 19 mm Hg. The capillary hydrostatic pressure remained at a normal value of 7 mm Hg, but it can sometimes increase to higher levels, exacerbating the formation of edema. The interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure has increased from a normal value of about -5 mm Hg to 1 mm Hg, which tends to decrease fluid loss from the capillaries. Excess fluid in the interstitial spaces (edema) causes lymph flow to increase."

      "Tissue interstitial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO₂) will increase",
      "Tissue pH will decrease"

    "explanation": "With an increase in blood flow to a tissue, with no change in metabolism, there will be an increase in tissue PO₂ due to the increased delivery of O₂ with no change in metabolism. This increase in tissue PO₂ leads to a decreased PCO₂ due to increased washout of CO₂ and an increase in pH, due to the fall in PCO₂."

An arterial content of 19 ml O₂/dl and a PO₂ of 95 suggest a normal Hb concentration. A low cardiac output would require a greater extraction of O₂ from the blood to supply O₂ to the tissue, resulting in a decreased mixed venous content."

Therefore, PO₂ will decrease from 100 to 40, PCO₂ will increase from 40 to 45, and systemic PO₂ will decrease because there is a decrease in O₂ uptake from the alveoli and thus decreased O₂ diffusion from the alveoli."

    "explanation": "To calculate inspired PO₂, one must remember that the air is humidified when it enters the body. Therefore, the humidified air has an effective total pressure of atmospheric pressure (760) – water vapor pressure (47), which yields a pressure of (760 – 47) = 713 mm Hg. The O₂ is 50% of the total gas, so the PO₂ is 713 × 0.5 = 356 mm Hg. To correct for the CO₂ in the alveoli, one then must subtract the PCO₂ divided by the respiratory quotient (normally 0.8). Therefore, the alveolar PO₂ = PO₂ - (PCO₂/R) = 356 - (40/0.8) = 356 - 50 = 306 mm Hg."

The greater the pressure gradient, the faster the diffusion. The larger the cross-sectional area of the membrane, the higher will be the total number of molecules that can diffuse through the membrane. The higher the solubility of the gas, the higher will be the number of gas molecules available to diffuse for a given difference in pressure. When the distance of the diffusion pathway is shorter, it will take less time for the molecules to diffuse the entire distance. When the MW of the gas molecule is decreased, the velocity of kinetic movement of the molecule will be higher, which also increases the rate of diffusion."

To decrease alveolar PCO₂, there must be increased VA in relation to metabolism. Low PO₂ will not directly affect PCO₂, but it can stimulate respiration (if PO₂ is sufficiently low), which would then reduce PCO₂. An increased metabolism with unchanged VA will increase PCO₂. A doubling in metabolism with a doubling in VA will have no effect on PCO₂."

    "question": "The diffusing capacity of a gas is the volume of gas that will diffuse through a membrane each minute for a pressure difference of 1 mm Hg. Which gas is often used to estimate the O₂-diffusing capacity of the lungs?",
    "options": [
      "CO₂",
      "CO",
      "Cyanide gas",
      "Nitrogen",
      "O₂"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "It is not practical to measure the O₂-diffusing capacity directly because it is not possible to measure accurately the O₂ tension of the pulmonary capillary blood. However, the diffusing capacity for CO can be measured accurately because the CO tension in pulmonary capillary blood is zero under normal conditions. The CO diffusing capacity is then used to calculate the O₂-diffusing capacity by taking into account the differences in diffusion coefficient between O₂ and CO."

      "CO₂: 90, O₂: 40"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Because the blood that perfuses the pulmonary capillaries is venous blood returning to the lungs (i.e., mixed venous blood) from the systemic circulation, it is the gases in this blood with which the alveolar gases equilibrate. Therefore, when an airway is blocked, the alveolar air equilibrates with the mixed venous blood and the partial pressures of the gases in both the blood and alveolar air become identical."

      "Both A and B",
      "Neither A nor B"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "O₂ diffuses from the lung into the blood and is both dissolved and bound to Hb. In spite of having no red blood cells, the PO₂ would be normal as the O₂ is dissolved in the plasma. The content would be minimal, just due to the dissolved O₂ in the plasma."

He undergoes ventilation with a gas mixture of 60% O₂ and 40% nitrogen. The artificial ventilation is stopped and he fails to breathe for several minutes. This apneic episode is due to which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "High arterial PO₂ suppressing the activity of the peripheral chemoreceptors",
      "Decrease in arterial pH suppressing the activity of the peripheral chemoreceptors",
      "Low arterial PCO₂ suppressing the activity of the medullary chemoreceptors",
      "High arterial PCO₂ suppressing the activity of the medullary chemoreceptors",
      "Low arterial PCO₂ suppressing the activity of the peripheral chemoreceptors"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient would have increased VA, therefore resulting in a decrease in arterial PCO₂. The effect of this decrease in PCO₂ would be an inhibition of the chemosensitive area and a decrease in ventilation until PCO₂ was back to normal. Breathing high O₂ does not decrease nerve activity sufficient to decrease respiration. The response of peripheral chemoreceptors to CO₂ and pH is mild and does not play a major role in the control of respiration."

    "options": [
      "Increased alveolar PO₂",
      "Increased alveolar PCO₂",
      "Decreased arterial PCO₂",
      "Increased pH"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "In a normal person the alveolar gases are the same as the arterial blood. With rebreathing, the exhaled CO₂ is never removed and continues to accumulate in the bag. This increase in alveolar and thus arterial PCO₂ will be the stimulus for the increased breathing. The alveolar PO₂ will be decreased, not increased, with the decreased PO₂ stimulating breathing. A decreased PCO₂ will not stimulate ventilation. An increased pH, alkalosis, will not stimulate ventilation."

    "question": "VA increases severalfold during strenuous exercise. Which factor is most likely to stimulate ventilation during strenuous exercise?",
    "options": [
      "Collateral impulses from higher brain centers",

      "Decreased mean arterial PO₂",
      "Decreased mean venous PO₂",
      "Increased mean arterial PCO₂"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Because strenuous exercise does not significantly change the mean arterial PO₂, PCO₂, or pH, it is unlikely that these play an important role in stimulating the immense increase in ventilation. Although the mean venous PO₂ decreases during exercise, the venous vasculature does not contain chemoreceptors that can sense PO₂. The brain, upon transmitting motor impulses to the contracting muscles, is believed to transmit collateral impulses to the brain stem to excite the respiratory center. Also, the movement of body parts during exercise is believed to excite joint and muscle proprioceptors that then transmit excitatory impulses to the respiratory center."

      "Decreased alveolar PO₂",
      "Decreased pulmonary capillary number"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "A person with emphysema has an increase in airway resistance, a decrease in diffusing capacity (affecting gas exchange), an abnormal V/Q ratio (possible shunt), and a loss of large portions of the alveolar walls and capillaries. This loss of capillaries leads to an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and the development of pulmonary hypertension."

      "CO₂ activation of receptors in the lungs"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "CO₂ is the major controller of respiration as a result of a direct effect of H⁺ on the chemosensitive area of the medulla. H⁺ do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, CO₂ diffuses across the blood-brain barrier and then is converted to H⁺, which acts on the chemosensitive area. CO₂ and H⁺ activation of carotid bodies is minimal under normal conditions."

      "Pneumotaxic center",
      "Ventral respiratory group"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The pneumotaxic center transmits signals to the dorsal respiratory group that 'switch off' inspiratory signals, thus controlling the duration of the filling phase of the lung cycle. This has a secondary effect of increasing the rate of breathing because limitation of inspiration also shortens expiration and the entire period of respiration."

    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "The basic rhythm of respiration is generated in the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, which is located almost entirely within the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. When the respiratory drive for increased pulmonary ventilation becomes greater than normal, respiratory signals spill over into the ventral respiratory neurons, causing the ventral respiratory area to contribute to the respiratory drive. However, neurons of the ventral respiratory group remain almost totally inactive during normal quiet breathing."

    "explanation": "Residual volume (RV) cannot be measured by spirometry. Therefore, any lung volume or capacity that includes the RV cannot be measured by spirometry. Measurements that include RV are functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC). Vital capacity (VC) does not include RV and is, therefore, measurable by spirometry. Physiologic dead space is not measurable by spirometry and requires sampling of arterial PCO₂ and expired CO₂."

      "Collapse of the small alveoli",
      "Increased lung compliance",
      "Normal breathing rate",
      "Lecithin:sphingomyelin ratio of greater than 2:1 in amniotic fluid"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is caused by lack of adequate surfactant in the immature lung. Surfactant appears between the 24th and the 35th gestational week. In the absence of surfactant, the surface tension of the small alveoli is too high. When the pressure on the small alveoli is too high (P = 2T/r), the small alveoli collapse into larger alveoli. There is decreased gas exchange with the larger, collapsed alveoli; and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, hypoxemia, and cyanosis occur. The lack of surfactant also decreases lung compliance, making it harder to inflate the lungs, increasing the work of breathing, and producing dyspnea (shortness of breath). Generally, lecithin:sphingomyelin ratios greater than 2:1 signify mature levels of surfactant."

      "Muscle",
      "Skin"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Pulmonary blood flow is controlled locally by the PO₂ of alveolar air. Hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction and thereby shunts blood away from unventilated areas of the lung, where it would be wasted. In the coronary circulation, hypoxemia causes vasodilation. The cerebral, muscle, and skin circulations are not controlled directly by PO₂."

      "Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio is increased in the affected areas of his lungs",
      "His arterial PCO₂ is higher than normal because of inadequate gas exchange",
      "His arterial PCO₂ is lower than normal because hypoxemia is causing him to hyperventilate",
      "His residual volume (RV) is decreased"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The patient’s arterial PCO₂ is lower than the normal value of 40 mm Hg because hypoxemia has stimulated peripheral chemoreceptors to increase his breathing rate; hyperventilation causes the patient to blow off extra CO₂ and results in respiratory alkalosis. In an obstructive disease, such as asthma, both forced expiratory volume (FEV₁) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are decreased, with the larger decrease occurring in FEV₁. Therefore, the FEV₁/FVC ratio is decreased. Poor ventilation of the affected areas decreases the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio and causes hypoxemia. The patient’s residual volume (RV) is increased because he is breathing at a higher lung volume to offset the increased resistance of his airways."

    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "During inspiration, intrapleural pressure becomes more negative than it is at rest or during expiration (when it returns to its less negative resting value). During inspiration, air flows into the lungs when alveolar pressure becomes lower (due to contraction of the diaphragm) than atmospheric pressure; if alveolar pressure were not lower than atmospheric pressure, air would not flow inward.

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The distribution of blood flow in the lungs is affected by gravitational effects on arterial hydrostatic pressure. Thus, blood flow is highest at the base, where arterial hydrostatic pressure is greatest and the difference between arterial and venous pressure is also greatest. This pressure difference drives the blood flow."

    "explanation": "The medium-sized bronchi actually constitute the site of highest resistance along the bronchial tree. Although the small radii of the alveoli might predict that they would have the highest resistance, they do not because of their parallel arrangement. In fact, early changes in resistance in the small airways may be 'silent' and go undetected because of their small overall contribution to resistance."

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Alveolar Po₂ in the left lung will equal the Po₂ in inspired air. Because there is no blood flow to the left lung, there can be no gas exchange between the alveolar air and the pulmonary capillary blood. Consequently, O₂ is not added to the capillary blood. The ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio in the left lung will be infinite (not zero or lower than that in the normal right lung) because Q (the denominator) is zero. Systemic arterial Po₂ will, of course, be decreased because the left lung has no gas exchange. Alveolar Po₂ in the right lung is unaffected."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Strenuous exercise increases the temperature and decreases the pH of skeletal muscle; both effects would cause the hemoglobin–O₂ dissociation curve to shift to the right, making it easier to unload O₂ in the tissues to meet the high demand of the exercising muscle. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (DPG) binds to the β chains of adult hemoglobin and reduces its affinity for O₂, shifting the curve to the right. In fetal hemoglobin, the β chains are replaced by γ chains, which do not bind 2,3-DPG, so the curve is shifted to the left. Because carbon monoxide (CO) increases the affinity of the remaining binding sites for O₂, the curve is shifted to the left."

    "explanation": "A shift to the right of the hemoglobin–O₂ dissociation curve represents decreased affinity of hemoglobin for O₂. At any given PO₂, the percent saturation is decreased, the P₅₀ is increased (read the PO₂ from the graph at 50% hemoglobin saturation), and unloading of O₂ in the tissues is facilitated. The O₂-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is the mL of O₂ that can be bound to a gram of hemoglobin at 100% saturation and is unaffected by the shift from curve A to curve B."

Vτ and breathing frequency are given, but dead space must be calculated. Dead space is Vτ multiplied by the difference between arterial PCO₂ and expired PCO₂ divided by arterial PCO₂. Thus, dead space = 0.45 × (41 − 35/41) = 0.066 L. Alveolar ventilation is then calculated as (0.45 L − 0.066 L) × 16 breaths/min = 6.14 L/min."

    "explanation": "Ventilation and perfusion of the lung are not distributed uniformly. Both are lowest at the apex and highest at the base. However, the differences for ventilation are not as great as for perfusion, making the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios higher at the apex and lower at the base. As a result, gas exchange is more efficient at the apex and less efficient at the base. Therefore, blood leaving the apex will have a higher PO₂ and a lower PCO₂."

This matching is accomplished without a change in mean arterial PO₂ or PCO₂. Venous PCO₂ increases because extra CO₂ is being produced by the exercising muscle. Because this CO₂ will be blown off by the hyperventilating lungs, it does not increase the arterial PCO₂. Pulmonary blood flow (cardiac output) increases manifold during strenuous exercise."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Hypoxia is defined as decreased O₂ delivery to the tissues. It occurs as a result of decreased blood flow or decreased O₂ content of the blood. Decreased O₂ content of the blood is caused by decreased hemoglobin concentration (anemia), decreased O₂-binding capacity of hemoglobin (carbon monoxide poisoning), or decreased arterial PO₂ (hypoxemia). Hypoventilation, right-to-left cardiac shunt, and ascent to high altitude all cause hypoxia by decreasing arterial PO₂. Of these, only right-to-left cardiac shunt is associated with an increased A–a gradient, reflecting a lack of O₂ equilibration between alveolar gas and systemic arterial blood. In right-to-left shunt, a portion of the right heart output, or pulmonary blood flow, is not oxygenated in the lungs and thereby 'dilutes' the PO₂ of the normally oxygenated blood. With hypoventilation and ascent to high altitude, both alveolar and arterial PO₂ are decreased, but the A–a gradient is normal."

    "question": "A 42-year-old woman with severe pulmonary fibrosis is evaluated by her physician and has the following arterial blood gases: pH = 7.48, PaO₂ = 55 mm Hg, and PaCO₂ = 32 mm Hg. Which statement best explains the observed value of PaCO₂?",
    "options": [
      "The increased pH stimulates breathing via peripheral chemoreceptors",

      "The decreased PaO₂ stimulates breathing via central chemoreceptors"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The patient’s arterial blood gases show increased pH, decreased PaO₂, and decreased PaCO₂. The decreased PaO₂ causes hyperventilation (stimulates breathing) via the peripheral chemoreceptors, but not via the central chemoreceptors. The decreased PaCO₂ results from hyperventilation (increased breathing) and causes increased pH, which inhibits breathing via the peripheral and central chemoreceptors."

    "options": [
      "Hypoventilation",
      "Arterial PO₂ greater than 100 mm Hg",
      "Decreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) concentration",

      "Pulmonary vasodilation",
      "Hypertrophy of the left ventricle",
      "Respiratory acidosis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "At high altitudes, the PO₂ of alveolar air is decreased because barometric pressure is decreased. As a result, arterial PO₂ is decreased (<100 mm Hg), and hypoxemia occurs and causes hyperventilation by an effect on peripheral chemoreceptors. Hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (DPG) levels increase adaptively; 2,3-DPG binds to hemoglobin and causes the hemoglobin–O₂ dissociation curve to shift to the right to improve unloading of O₂ in the tissues. The pulmonary vasculature vasoconstricts in response to alveolar hypoxia, resulting in increased pulmonary arterial pressure and hypertrophy of the right ventricle (not the left ventricle)."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "In venous blood, CO₂ combines with H₂O and produces the weak acid H₂CO₃, catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. The resulting H⁺ is buffered by deoxyhemoglobin, which is such an effective buffer for H⁺ (meaning that the pK is within 1.0 unit of the pH of blood) that the pH of venous blood is only slightly more acid than the pH of arterial blood.

Regions of low V/Q have the highest blood flow. Thus, breathing high PO₂ air will raise the PO₂ of a large volume of blood and have the greatest influence on the total blood flow leaving the lungs (which becomes systemic arterial blood). Dead space (i.e., V/Q = ∞) has no blood flow, so supplemental O₂ has no effect on these regions. Shunt (i.e., V/Q = 0) has no ventilation, so supplemental O₂ has no effect. Regions of high V/Q have little blood flow, thus raising the PO₂ of a small volume of blood will have little overall effect on systemic arterial blood."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Increased A–a gradient signifies lack of O₂ equilibration between alveolar gas (A) and systemic arterial blood (a). In pulmonary fibrosis, there is thickening of the alveolar/pulmonary capillary barrier and increased diffusion distance for O₂, which results in lack of equilibration of O₂, hypoxemia, and increased A–a gradient. Hypoventilation and ascent to 12,000 feet also cause hypoxemia, because systemic arterial blood is equilibrated with a lower alveolar PO₂ (normal A–a gradient). Persons breathing 50% or 100% O₂ will have elevated alveolar PO₂, and their arterial PO₂ will equilibrate with this higher value (normal A–a gradient)."

      "Fibrosis",
      "Carbon monoxide poisoning",

    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Since the woman is hypoxemic at sea level and breathing a mixture containing a normal % of O₂, she cannot have normal lung function. Also, because she is hypoxemic, she does not have carbon monoxide poisoning (which would decrease O₂ content of blood but would not decrease PaO₂). Right-to-left shunt as the cause of the woman’s hypoxemia is further supported by calculating the A–a gradient as follows. P₁O₂ = (760 mm Hg - 47 mm Hg) × 0.21 = 150 mm Hg, PaO₂ = 150 mm Hg - 45 mm Hg/0.8 = 94 mm Hg.

      "V/Q defect",
      "Right-to-left shunt",
      "Anemia"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Anemia (or decreased hemoglobin concentration) is eliminated because it causes decreased O₂ content of blood but does not cause hypoxemia. The remaining choices all cause hypoxemia. Calculating the A–a gradient distinguishes between these causes as follows: P₁O₂ = (760 mm Hg - 47 mm Hg) × 0.21 = 150 mm Hg, PaO₂ = 150 mm Hg - 70 mm Hg/0.8 = 63 mm Hg. A–a gradient = 63 mm Hg – 60 mm Hg = 3 mm Hg, which is normal. Among the choices, the only cause of hypoxemia with a normal A–a gradient is hypoventilation, whereby PaO₂ is lowered by hypoventilation and PaO₂ equilibrates with that lowered value; since PaO₂ and PaO₂ are equilibrated (but lower than normal), they are essentially equal and A–a is close to zero, or normal. Fibrosis, V/Q defect, and right-to-left shunt all cause decreased PaO₂ that is not equilibrated with PaO₂ and thus cause increased A–a gradient."

      "Inhibits ovulation",
      "Increased in females after menopause",
      "Not needed for spermatogenesis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "LH (luteinizing hormone) is increased in females after menopause due to the loss of negative feedback from ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone). After menopause, the ovaries stop producing these hormones, leading to elevated levels of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) as the pituitary is no longer inhibited. LH is a glycoprotein (not a simple protein), is present in males where it stimulates testosterone production, triggers ovulation (rather than inhibiting it), and is essential for spermatogenesis by stimulating testosterone production in Leydig cells."

      "Mental retardation"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Turner syndrome (45,XO) is characterized by absent ovaries (ovarian agenesis), where the ovaries are replaced by fibrous streaks. Patients have female genitalia (not male), short stature (not tall), and typically normal intelligence (no mental retardation). Gynecomastia is characteristic of Klinefelter syndrome, not Turner syndrome."

      "Cowper's glands",
      "Epididymis", 
      "Ejaculatory ducts"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The seminal vesicles provide about 70% of the seminal fluid volume. Their secretion contains proteins, enzymes, fructose, mucus, and prostaglandins. The prostate contributes 10-30%, Cowper's glands produce pre-ejaculate fluid, the epididymis stores and matures sperm but doesn't contribute significantly to fluid volume, and the ejaculatory ducts are passageways rather than secretory glands."

      "LH",
      "FSH", 
      "Estrogen",
      "Progesterone",
      "hCG"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Progesterone rises significantly following ovulation as the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes large amounts of progesterone (along with some estrogen). LH and FSH decline after ovulation due to negative feedback from progesterone and estrogen. Estrogen has two peaks - one just before ovulation and another during the mid-luteal phase. hCG is only produced during pregnancy."

  {
    "question": "During pregnancy, the corpus luteum:",
    "options": [
      "Is known as the corpus albicans",
      "Is controlled by the placenta",
      "Is essential for maintenance of pregnancy", 
      "Degenerates during the second trimester",
      "Responds to both FSH and LH"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The corpus luteum is essential for maintaining pregnancy during the first 6-8 weeks by producing progesterone and estrogen until the placenta takes over hormone production. It is maintained by hCG from the placenta (not controlled by it), doesn't degenerate until after delivery, responds primarily to LH (not FSH), and the corpus albicans is the degenerated form after luteal regression."

      "Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and Basophils of the pituitary",
      "Germ cells, Leydig cells and stem cells of the bone marrow",
      "Cutaneous cells, Sertoli cells and neural cells in the hypothalamus"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Normal spermatogenesis requires: Sertoli cells (for physical support, blood-testes barrier, and nutrient provision), Leydig cells (for testosterone production), and basophils of the pituitary (which secrete FSH and LH). Germ cells alone are insufficient without the supporting cells and hormonal regulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "The corpus luteum of pregnancy:",

      "Is under control of LH",
      "Is formed only from theca interna cells",
      "Produces progesterone but not estrogen", 
      "Degenerates as soon as the fertilized ovum is implanted",
      "Requires human chorionic gonadotrophin"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "The corpus luteum of pregnancy requires human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for its maintenance beyond the normal luteal phase. hCG acts as a luteotropic and luteinizing hormone, preventing degeneration of the corpus luteum and ensuring continued production of progesterone and estrogen during early pregnancy until the placenta takes over hormone production."
  },
  {
    "question": "Normal spermatogenesis requires:",
    "options": [
      "A peak of LH",
      "FSH and testosterone", 
      "A temperature equal to body temperature",
      "Low potassium in seminal fluid",
      "120 days for development of sperms"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Normal spermatogenesis requires both FSH (which acts on Sertoli cells to produce androgen-binding protein) and testosterone (which is essential for the conversion of spermatids to spermatozoa). Spermatogenesis occurs at temperatures lower than body temperature (about 32°C), takes approximately 74 days (not 120), and the potassium concentration in seminal fluid is not a determining factor."

      "Ovulation",
      "LH peak during mid-cycle",
      "Ductular growth in the breast"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Progesterone makes the cervical mucus thick, scanty, and difficult to penetrate by sperm. The proliferative phase is caused by estrogen (not progesterone), ovulation is triggered by the LH surge (not progesterone), the LH peak occurs before significant progesterone production, and ductular growth in the breast is primarily estrogen-mediated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Ovulation:",
    "options": [
      "Normally occurs 14 days following uterine bleeding",
      "Immediately occurs following LH surge",
      "Is usually associated with a central abdominal pain", 
      "Is due to rupture of the corpus luteum",
      "Leads to a rise in the body temperature"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Ovulation leads to a rise in body temperature due to the thermogenic effect of progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum. Ovulation occurs 14 days BEFORE the next menstrual period (not after bleeding), occurs about 9 hours after the LH peak (not immediately), is associated with lower abdominal pain (not central), and results from rupture of the mature follicle (not the corpus luteum)."

      "FSH",
      "Progesterone", 
      "Estradiol",
      "hCG",
      "LH"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Pregnancy tests detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast of the developing placenta. hCG appears in blood about 6 days after implantation and in urine about 14 days after implantation. The other hormones are not specific to pregnancy and cannot reliably indicate pregnancy."

  {
    "question": "Concerning spermatogenesis, which of the following is correct:",
    "options": [
      "Sperm production is cyclic",
      "Continuous release of GnRH is essential for spermatogenesis", 
      "Sertoli cells are needed for mitotic and meiotic activity of germ cells",
      "FSH acts on Leydig cells to stimulate release of testosterone",
      "LH acts on Sertoli cells to stimulate release androgen binding protein"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Sertoli cells provide physical support and nutrients essential for both mitotic and meiotic divisions of germ cells during spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is continuous (not cyclic) in males, GnRH release is pulsatile (not continuous), FSH acts on Sertoli cells (not Leydig cells), and LH acts on Leydig cells (not Sertoli cells) to stimulate testosterone production."

  {
    "question": "During 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, the primary source of estrogen and progesterone is the:",
    "options": [
      "Corpus luteum",
      "Granulosa and theca cells in ovaries", 
      "Placenta",
      "Adrenal cortex",
      "Pituitary gland"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "After the first 6-8 weeks of pregnancy, the placenta becomes the primary source of estrogen and progesterone. The corpus luteum degenerates around this time, the ovarian follicles are inactive during pregnancy, and while the adrenal cortex produces some androgens that can be converted to estrogen, it is not the primary source."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following statements about estrogen is not true:",
    "options": [
      "Interacts with intracellular protein receptors",
      "Increases synthesis of thyroid binding protein", 
      "Decreases uterine contractions",
      "Decreases FSH secretion",
      "Is released from the testes"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Estrogen actually increases uterine contractions by making the uterus more excitable to oxytocin, not decreasing them. All other statements are true: estrogen interacts with intracellular receptors, increases hepatic production of thyroid-binding globulin, exerts negative feedback on FSH secretion (except at mid-cycle), and small amounts are produced in the testes via aromatase conversion of androgens."

  {
    "question": "Testosterone is not:",
    "options": [
      "Produced during intra-uterine life",
      "An anabolic hormone", 
      "Mostly protein bound",
      "Inhibited directly by inhibin",
      "Inhibitory to LH"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Testosterone is NOT directly inhibited by inhibin. Inhibin specifically inhibits FSH secretion, not testosterone. Testosterone is produced during intrauterine life, has anabolic effects (promotes protein synthesis), is 98% protein-bound in plasma, and exerts negative feedback inhibition on LH secretion."

    "explanation": "The LH peak at mid-cycle is preceded by a peak in estrogen levels. Just before ovulation, rising estrogen switches from negative to positive feedback on the pituitary, triggering the LH surge. The corpus luteum is maintained by LH (not estrogen), progesterone is lowest during early menstrual days, ovulation depends on LH surge (not FSH), and the follicular phase variability determines cycle length (the luteal phase is relatively constant at 14 days)."

    "explanation": "Pregnancy does NOT increase lung volumes and capacities; in fact, the upward displacement of the diaphragm by the enlarged uterus actually REDUCES lung volumes. All other options are correct maternal adaptations: GFR increases by 50-60%, plasma volume increases by 40-50%, cardiac output increases by 30-50%, and while red blood cell mass increases, the relative hemodilution can give the appearance of decreased erythropoiesis."

Physical examination revealed a tall female with a short, blind-ended vagina and no palpable cervix. Ultrasound showed the absence of a uterus and no ovaries and the presence of undescended testes. Deficiency of which enzyme, hormone, or receptor is most likely to account for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "Androgen receptors",
      "Aromatase",

    "explanation": "This describes complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (testicular feminization). The patient has a 46,XY karyotype with testes that produce testosterone and MIS normally. However, due to androgen receptor deficiency, the body cannot respond to androgens, leading to female external genitalia development. MIS from Sertoli cells causes regression of Müllerian structures (uterus, fallopian tubes), resulting in a blind vaginal pouch. The testes remain undescended, and patients are tall due to delayed epiphyseal closure from lack of androgen effects."

The sample contains low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and high levels of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin. Assuming a normal 28-day menstrual cycle, on which day of this woman's menstrual cycle was the blood sample taken?",

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Day 21 corresponds to the mid-luteal phase when the corpus luteum is fully functional, secreting high levels of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin. These hormones exert strong negative feedback on the pituitary, suppressing FSH and LH secretion. This hormonal profile is characteristic of the luteal phase and essential for preparing the endometrium for potential implantation."

    "explanation": "Oxytocin is responsible for milk ejection (let-down reflex) by causing contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding breast alveoli. This reflex can be conditioned by various stimuli including infant crying, thinking about the baby, or emotional states. Prolactin is responsible for milk production (lactogenesis), not milk ejection."

    "question": "A 36-year-old woman who is pregnant with her third child is in labor. Her serum oxytocin levels were measured at regular intervals over a 24-hour period. Measurements were taken at the onset when the woman began having low back pains 1 day before delivery and ended 3 hours after delivery of the infant, just before the woman was to begin breast-feeding the infant. A normal vaginal delivery was completed without medical intervention. At what time was the oxytocin concentration in maternal blood most likely to be highest?",

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Oxytocin levels peak during the expulsive stage of labor when the fetus descends and cervical dilation is maximal. This creates a positive feedback loop: cervical stretching stimulates oxytocin release, which causes stronger uterine contractions, leading to more cervical stretching. This Ferguson reflex ensures progressive labor until delivery."

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Sustained high levels of estrogen from the developing dominant follicle switch from negative to positive feedback on the pituitary around mid-cycle. This positive feedback sensitizes gonadotropes to GnRH, triggering the LH surge that induces ovulation. This is a unique neuroendocrine phenomenon specific to the menstrual cycle."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Day 14 corresponds to ovulation when estrogen levels peak. Under estrogen dominance, cervical mucus becomes thin, watery, and alkaline, forming a fern-like crystallization pattern when dried. This facilitates sperm transport and survival. Progesterone-dominated mucus (luteal phase) is thick and does not fern."

    "explanation": "Vasectomy involves cutting and sealing the vas deferens, preventing sperm transport from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts. Semen (composed of secretions from seminal vesicles, prostate, and Cowper's glands) is still ejaculated, but it contains no sperm. Sperm production continues but sperm are phagocytosed in the epididymis."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "5α-reductase deficiency impairs conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is essential for normal development of external male genitalia (penis, scrotum, prostate). At puberty, high testosterone levels can partially overcome this deficiency, leading to virilization (phallic growth, muscle development, voice deepening) as testosterone can bind androgen receptors, though less effectively than DHT."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Estrogen synthesis requires the two-cell system: Theca interna cells (under LH stimulation) produce androgens from cholesterol. These androgens diffuse to granulosa cells, where FSH-stimulated aromatase converts them to estrogens. Granulosa cells lack the enzymes for de novo androgen synthesis but are rich in aromatase. Without thecal cell-derived androgens, granulosa cells cannot produce significant estrogen."

    "explanation": "This describes true precocious puberty. Early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis leads to premature sex steroid production, causing an early growth spurt and advanced bone age. However, early epiphyseal closure results in short adult stature. The history of early pubic/axillary hair development and initially being taller than peers, followed by short adult height, is characteristic of precocious puberty with premature growth plate fusion."

    "explanation": "The temperature of the testes must be considerably below that of the internal body temperature for spermatogenesis to occur. The testes are normally maintained at a temperature of about 32°C, and are kept cool by a countercurrent heat exchange between the spermatic arteries and veins and by air circulating around the scrotum. The testes develop in the abdomen but normally descend into the scrotum during fetal development. In ~10% of newborn males, one or, less commonly, both testes remain in the abdominal cavity or inguinal canal. Although most (98%) of undescended testes (cryptorchidism) spontaneously descend by 1 year, and all but 0.3% spontaneously descend by puberty, early surgical treatment is recommended because abdominal temperatures can cause irreversible damage to the spermatogenic epithelium and the incidence of malignant tumors is higher in undesecnded than in scrotal testes. Maturation of spermatogonia, the primitive germ cells, into primary spermatocytes does not begin until adolescence. Throughout the reproductive life of the human male, 100 to 200 million sperm are produced daily. Of critical importance to the hormonal regulation of spermatogenesis are the pulsatile release of GRH and the subsequent involvement of FSH and LH at their target cells. FSH acts directly on the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules to initiate mitotic and meiotic activity of germ cells. LH effects are thought to be mediated via stimulation of testosterone secretion by the Leydig cells."

Normal adult serum levels of prolactin are about the same or only slightly higher in females compared to males. Consistent with its role in lactogenesis, prolactin secretion increases during pregnancy. Suckling increases prolactin secretion, but milk ejection during suckling is due to oxytocin release. Prolactin inhibits reproductive function by inhibiting hypothalamic GnRH release and pituitary gonadotropin secretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both males and females. Pregnancy and lactation are the most important physiological causes of hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, hypothyroidism, and drug-induced inhibition or disruption of dopaminergic receptor function are other common causes of hyperprolactinemia."

The placenta serves as the source of the hormones during the remainder of pregnancy. Progesterone is essential to maintain placental implantation, inhibit uterine contractions, and suppress the maternal immune system response to fetal antigens. Estrogens serve to increase the size of the uterus, induce progesterone and oxytocin receptors, stimulate maternal hepatic protein secretion, and promote breast development. Estrid is the major estrogen produced during pregnancy. The production of estrogen and progesterone during gestation requires cooperation between the maternal, placental, and fetal compartments—the fetoplacental unit."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Ovulation takes place just after the peak of the luteinizing hormone (LH) and estrogen curves, which occurs on approximately the fourteenth day of the menstrual cycle. Although FSH is primarily responsible for follicular maturation within the ovary, LH is necessary for final follicular maturation; without it, ovulation cannot take place. Both estrogen, following a sharp preovulatory rise in plasma concentration, and progesterone are secreted in abundance by the postovulatory corpus luteum."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "There is a marked increase in progesterone secretion following ovulation. Almost all the progesterone secreted in nonpregnant women is secreted by the corpus luteum. Secretion of both progesterone and estrogen is controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH) released by the adenohypophysis, and LH release itself is under the direction of a hypothalamic releasing factor."

    "question": "An 18-year-old emaciated female who has been on a strict diet regimen and training for a marathon presents with amenorrhea. Exogenous pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) restores ovulation and menses. Ovulation is caused by a sudden increase in the secretion of which of the following hormones?",
    "options": [
      "LH",
      "FSH",
      "GnRH",
      "Estrogen",
      "Progesterone"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Ovulation is caused by a sudden increase in LH secretion. Both LH and FSH blood levels increase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and reach peak blood levels prior to ovulation. Estrogen levels follow a similar pattern during the follicular phase. The physiological signal for ovulation is a surge in LH blood levels. Under the influence of LH, thecal and granulosa cells become the luteal cells of the corpus luteum. Progesterone production by the corpus luteum increases significantly. Estrogen levels also increase, but do not reach the levels achieved during the follicular phase. In anorexia nervosa, the regulation of virtually every endocrine system is altered, but the most striking changes occur in the reproductive system. Amenorrhea in anorexia nervosa is hypothalamic in origin and reflects decreased production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (with low levels of LH and FSH) that may be due to a marked reduction in leptin associated with the decreased mass of adipose tissue. In up to 25% of patients, however, amenorrhea precedes significant weight loss."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Ovulation occurs at point A on the graph. In response to estrogen secretion by the ovary, the endometrial lining of the uterus undergoes proliferation of both glandular epithelium and supporting stroma during the first 10 to 14 days of the menstrual cycle. Following ovulation, the glands begin to secrete mucus and the stroma undergoes pseudodecidual reaction in preparation for potential pregnancy. When ovulation is not followed by implantation of a fertilized ovum, progesterone secretion declines as the corpus luteum involutes, and the endometrial lining is almost completely shed during menses."

    "explanation": "Progesterone production by the corpus luteum increases significantly at the time of ovulation. Progesterone affects the set point for thermoregulation and increases body temperature approximately 0.58°F. Both LH and FSH blood levels increase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and reach peak blood levels prior to ovulation. Estrogen levels follow a similar pattern during the follicular phase. The physiologic signal for ovulation is a surge in LH blood levels.

      "Expression of surface LH receptors"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The Sertoli cells rest on a basal lamina and form a layer around the periphery of the seminiferous tubules. They are attached to each other by specialized junctional complexes that limit the movement of fluid and solute molecules from the interstitial space and blood to the tubular lumen, and thus form a blood-testis barrier that provides an immunologically privileged environment for sperm maturation. Sertoli cells are intimately associated with developing spermatozoa and play a major role in germ-cell maturation. They secrete a variety of serum proteins and an androgen-binding protein into the tubular fluid in response to FSH and testosterone stimulation. Testosterone is synthesized and secreted by the interstitial Leydig cells. Estrogen is produced in small amounts by the Sertoli cells before puberty."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) begins to appear in the maternal blood approximately 6 to 8 days following ovulation, upon implantation of the fertilized ovum in the endometrium. The secretion of hCG is essential to prevent involution of the corpus luteum and to stimulate secretion of progesterone and estrogens, which continues until the placenta becomes large enough to secrete sufficient quantities of those hormones. Following a peak at 7 to 9 weeks, hCG secretion gradually declines to a low level by 20 weeks gestation."

    "question": "A woman presents to her obstetrician with concerns that she has had trouble breast feeding. She reports that her mother-in-law told her that alcohol would relax her and allow her milk to flow more readily, but it has not helped, even with drinking up to a bottle of wine a day. Which of the following hormones is involved in the ejection of milk from a lactating mammary gland?",
    "options": [
      "Growth hormone",
      "FSH",
      "LH",
      "Prolactin",
      "Oxytocin"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "A combined neurogenic and hormonal reflex involving oxytocin, a posterior pituitary hormone, causes the actual ejection (\"let-down\") of milk from breast tissue. Although estrogen and progesterone are essential for the physical development of breast tissue during pregnancy, both hormones inhibit milk secretion. Milk secretion is regulated by prolactin, a pituitary hormone secreted throughout pregnancy and after parturition. Adequate amounts of growth hormone are required to provide the nutrients that are essential for milk production by breast tissue. Suckling on breast tissue is the stimulus that leads to milk secretion. The secretion of oxytocin is increased by stressful stimuli, and inhibited by alcohol. Furthermore, alcohol is transferred from the mother's bloodstream into her breast milk and to the nursing infant, where it can have many deleterious effects."

    "explanation": "In a woman with a menstrual cycle of 28 to 30 days, ovulation generally occurs between days 14 and 16. The menstrual cycle is divided physiologically into three phases. The follicular phase begins with the onset of menses and lasts 9 to 13 days. The ovulatory phase lasts 1 to 3 days and culminates in ovulation. The luteal phase, the most constant phase of the cycle, lasts about 14 days and ends with the onset of menstrual bleeding."

    "question": "An 18-year-old college woman is brought to the Emergency Department by her roommate after she was raped walking back to the dorm from the library at night. She requests the 'morning after pill' she has heard about to prevent pregnancy from the violation. She is given a postcoital contraceptive to prevent implantation and induce regression of the corpus luteum. Which of the following is correct regarding implantation of the zygote in the uterine wall?",
    "options": [
      "Precedes formation of the zona pellucida",
      "Involves infiltration of the endometrium by the syncytiotrophoblast",
      "Occurs 3 to 5 days after fertilization",
      "Occurs when the embryo consists of approximately 128 cells",
      "Is inhibited by secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Implantation of a zygote into the uterine wall involves infiltration of the endometrium by the syncytiotrophoblast. Fertilization and early cleavage of the zygote occur in the fallopian tube in the human female. After approximately 3 days, the zygote enters the uterine cavity, where it undergoes additional divisions over a period of 3 to 4 days to form a morula of approximately 60 cells that is transformed into a blastocyst consisting of the yolk sac and embryo. Enzymatic digestion of the zona pellucida and infiltration of the endometrium by the syncytiotrophoblast, which forms the outer layer of the blastocyst, result in implantation of the blastocyst within the endometrium, where it erodes into maternal vessels. During these early stages of embryogenesis, the endometrium is primed by progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum in the ovary in response to pituitary gonadotropin secretion. After 10 to 15 days, placental gonadotropins maintain the corpus luteum until placental synthesis of progesterone is established at 6 to 8 weeks of gestation. Large dose estrogens, diethystilbesterol, and mifepristone (RU486) are examples of postcoital contraceptives."

      "Luteinizing hormone",
      "Progesterone"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Preparation of primordial ovarian follicles for ovulation is the primary function of FSH. FSH stimulates development of the theca and granulose cells of the follicles and promotes the synthesis of estrogens, including estradiol. LH promotes luteinization of the postovulatory follicle and stimulates progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum. During pregnancy, hCG is secreted by the placenta and continues progesterone production."

      "Plasma levels of progesterone decrease after ovulation."
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum. The plasma level of progesterone is low during the menses and remains low until just prior to ovulation. It rises substantially after ovulation, owing to secretion by the corpus luteum. If fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone until the placenta develops and begins to produce large amounts of the hormone. The plasma level of progesterone rises steadily throughout pregnancy after the placenta takes over production at about 12 weeks of gestation."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Estrogens cause the mucus secreted by the cervix to become thinner and more alkaline and to exhibit a fernlike pattern upon drying. The epithelium of the vagina is so sensitive to estrogen action that vaginal smear examination is used for a bioassay of the hormone. Estrogens can stimulate growth of ovarian follicles even in hypophysectomized women and also stimulate growth of the glandular epithelium of the endometrium, the smooth muscle of the uterus, and the uterine vascular system. Growth of the glandular elements of the breast is stimulated by progesterone; growth of the ductal elements is stimulated by estrogen."

Physical examination of the 22-year-old husband reveals mild obesity, gynecomastia, and decreased facial and axillary hair. He has male genitalia, but penile length is decreased and the testes are small. Chromosomal analysis reveals the XXY pattern of Klinefelter's syndrome. Which of the following is the principal androgen responsible for transforming undifferentiated external genitalia in the fetus into male external genitalia?",

      "Testosterone",
      "Androstenedione",
      "Androsterone",
      "Dihydrotestosterone",
      "Müllerian-inhibiting substance"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The testosterone metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induces the formation of the male external genitalia and male secondary sex characteristics. The fetus develops with bipotential internal and external genitalia that can develop (at about 40 days gestation) into either a testis or ovary, depending upon which genes are expressed. When the embryo has functional testes, male internal and external genitalia develop. The Leydig cells of the fetal testis secrete testosterone and the Sertoli cells secrete milleframinhibiting substance (MIS), also known as antimüllerian hormone (AMH), a member of the TGF-β growth factor family. The development of male internal genitalia depends upon testosterone, which stimulates growth and development of the Wolfflam ducts and MIS, which stimulates Müllerian duct regression. Individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome have an XXY chromosomal pattern, which is the most common sex chromosome disorder. These individuals have internal and external male genitalia, and testosterone secretion at puberty is often great enough for the development of male characteristics. However, the testes are small and the seminiferous tubules are abnormal, leading to infertility, ennuchoid proportions, gynecomastia, and poor virilization in phenotypic males. Mental retardation, developmental delay, or learning disabilities may be present. Patients with mosaic forms of Klinefelter's syndrome have less severe clinical features, larger testes, and may achieve fertility."

      "Estradiol",
      "Insulin",
      "Prolactin"

    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Prolactin causes milk secretion from the breast after estrogen and progesterone priming. Its effect on the breast involves increased action of mRNA and increased production of casein and lactalbumin, but the hormone action is not exerted on the cell nucleus. The actions of progesterone are prevented by inhibitors of microtubules. Oxytocin is a posterior pituitary peptide that promotes contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding breast ducts and causes expulsion of milk from lobular alveoli. Secretion of oxytocin is promoted by tactile stimulation of the breast by the nursing infant. It can also be elicited by psychic factors alone, such as the anticipation of nursing brought on by hearing the cry of the hungry infant. This anticipatory secretion of oxytocin may be experienced by the mother as a sensation of milk letdown in which milk appears at the nipple and may be forcibly ejected."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Because of the challenge of weighing the benefits versus risks for each individual, whether or not to use postmenopausal hormone therapy is one of the most complex health-care decisions facing women. In both observational studies and randomized trials, hormone therapy (either estrogen alone or estrogen/progestin) shows definite improvement in vasomotor symptoms (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and vaginal dryness, and in increasing bone density and reducing the risk of fractures. However, observational studies promoting the use of hormone therapy as a strategy to delay the postmenopausal onset of cardiovascular disease have recently been refuted by randomized trials showing an increased risk of coronary artery disease in stroke with hormone replacement therapy. Hormone therapy also increases the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer (with long-term use), venous thromboembolism, and gallbladder disease.

      "In the population, sperm counts in semen have increased over the last 20 years"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Semen contains chemicals that prevent sperm capacitation, thereby prolonging the viability of the sperm. In addition, the high potassium content of the secretion inhibits sperm motility, further adding to the viability. Semen is secreted primarily by the seminiferous tubules and the alkaline nature of the secretion buffers the acidity of the vagina.

      "FSH",
      "LH"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "In non-pregnant women, the secretion of prolactin is kept tonically suppressed by secretion of dopamine from the hypothalamus. Prolactin is the main hormone of lactation. Hormone levels increase early in pregnancy due to the influence of estrogens. However, lactation does not occur early in pregnancy because estrogens and progesterone inhibit the interaction of prolactin with receptors located on the alveolar cell membranes. At term, estrogen and progesterone levels decrease and milk production begins usually within 3 days of delivery."

    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "During pregnancy, the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary axis is suppressed due to high circulating levels of sex hormones. This leads to reduced gonadotropin levels, and, thus, ovulation does not occur. Additionally, hyperventilation leads to decreased arterial carbon dioxide levels. Increased water retention leads to decreased hematocrit. Maternal use of glucose declines and, as a result, glu-concogenesis increases. Plasma cortisol levels increase as the result of progesterone-mediated displacement from transcortin and its subsequent binding to globulin."

      "Not needed for spermatogenesis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "LH (luteinizing hormone) is increased in females after menopause due to the loss of negative feedback from ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone). After menopause, the ovaries stop producing these hormones, leading to elevated levels of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) as the pituitary is no longer inhibited. LH is a glycoprotein (not a simple protein), is present in males where it stimulates testosterone production, triggers ovulation (rather than inhibiting it), and is essential for spermatogenesis by stimulating testosterone production in Leydig cells."

    "explanation": "The seminal vesicles provide about 70% of the seminal fluid volume. Their secretion contains proteins, enzymes, fructose, mucus, and prostaglandins. The prostate contributes 10-30%, Cowper's glands produce pre-ejaculate fluid, the epididymis stores and matures sperm but doesn't contribute significantly to fluid volume, and the ejaculatory ducts are passageways rather than secretory glands."

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Progesterone rises significantly following ovulation as the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes large amounts of progesterone (along with some estrogen). LH and FSH decline after ovulation due to negative feedback from progesterone and estrogen. Estrogen has two peaks - one just before ovulation and another during the mid-luteal phase. hCG is only produced during pregnancy."

    "explanation": "The corpus luteum is essential for maintaining pregnancy during the first 6-8 weeks by producing progesterone and estrogen until the placenta takes over hormone production. It is maintained by hCG from the placenta (not controlled by it), doesn't degenerate until after delivery, responds primarily to LH (not FSH), and the corpus albicans is the degenerated form after luteal regression."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Normal spermatogenesis requires: Sertoli cells (for physical support, blood-testes barrier, and nutrient provision), Leydig cells (for testosterone production), and basophils of the pituitary (which secrete FSH and LH). Germ cells alone are insufficient without the supporting cells and hormonal regulation."

      "Degenerates as soon as the fertilized ovum is implanted",
      "Requires human chorionic gonadotrophin"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "The corpus luteum of pregnancy requires human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for its maintenance beyond the normal luteal phase. hCG acts as a luteotropic and luteinizing hormone, preventing degeneration of the corpus luteum and ensuring continued production of progesterone and estrogen during early pregnancy until the placenta takes over hormone production."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Normal spermatogenesis requires both FSH (which acts on Sertoli cells to produce androgen-binding protein) and testosterone (which is essential for the conversion of spermatids to spermatozoa). Spermatogenesis occurs at temperatures lower than body temperature (about 32°C), takes approximately 74 days (not 120), and the potassium concentration in seminal fluid is not a determining factor."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Progesterone makes the cervical mucus thick, scanty, and difficult to penetrate by sperm. The proliferative phase is caused by estrogen (not progesterone), ovulation is triggered by the LH surge (not progesterone), the LH peak occurs before significant progesterone production, and ductular growth in the breast is primarily estrogen-mediated."

      "Leads to a rise in the body temperature"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Ovulation leads to a rise in body temperature due to the thermogenic effect of progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum. Ovulation occurs 14 days BEFORE the next menstrual period (not after bleeding), occurs about 9 hours after the LH peak (not immediately), is associated with lower abdominal pain (not central), and results from rupture of the mature follicle (not the corpus luteum)."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Sertoli cells provide physical support and nutrients essential for both mitotic and meiotic divisions of germ cells during spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is continuous (not cyclic) in males, GnRH release is pulsatile (not continuous), FSH acts on Sertoli cells (not Leydig cells), and LH acts on Leydig cells (not Sertoli cells) to stimulate testosterone production."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "After the first 6-8 weeks of pregnancy, the placenta becomes the primary source of estrogen and progesterone. The corpus luteum degenerates around this time, the ovarian follicles are inactive during pregnancy, and while the adrenal cortex produces some androgens that can be converted to estrogen, it is not the primary source."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Estrogen actually increases uterine contractions by making the uterus more excitable to oxytocin, not decreasing them. All other statements are true: estrogen interacts with intracellular receptors, increases hepatic production of thyroid-binding globulin, exerts negative feedback on FSH secretion (except at mid-cycle), and small amounts are produced in the testes via aromatase conversion of androgens."

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Testosterone is NOT directly inhibited by inhibin. Inhibin specifically inhibits FSH secretion, not testosterone. Testosterone is produced during intrauterine life, has anabolic effects (promotes protein synthesis), is 98% protein-bound in plasma, and exerts negative feedback inhibition on LH secretion."

      "The life span of corpus luteum determines duration of the cycle"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The LH peak at mid-cycle is preceded by a peak in estrogen levels. Just before ovulation, rising estrogen switches from negative to positive feedback on the pituitary, triggering the LH surge. The corpus luteum is maintained by LH (not estrogen), progesterone is lowest during early menstrual days, ovulation depends on LH surge (not FSH), and the follicular phase variability determines cycle length (the luteal phase is relatively constant at 14 days)."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Testosterone is secreted by Leydig cells (interstitial cells), not Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells do secrete androgen binding protein (in response to FSH), Mullerian inhibitory substance (during fetal development), inhibin (which inhibits FSH), and estrogens (via aromatase conversion of androgens)."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The secondary spermatocyte contains 23 chromosomes (haploid) after the first meiotic division. Testosterone is essential for the final maturation of spermatids to spermatozoa, FSH is crucial for stimulating Sertoli cells, spermatogenesis takes 74 days (not hours), and Sertoli cells support but do not divide to form sperm - germ cells undergo the divisions."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Progesterone stimulates the respiratory center, causing hyperventilation during pregnancy and the luteal phase. Progesterone acts on intracellular receptors (not cell membrane), its thermogenic effect is metabolic (not via hypothalamic temperature center), estrogen (not progesterone) causes proliferative changes, and progesterone stimulates lobular and alveolar breast development (not ductular, which is estrogen-mediated)."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "hCS causes lipolysis, providing free fatty acids as an alternative energy source for the mother. hCS is a protein hormone (not steroid), reduces glucose utilization by the MOTHER (not fetus) to spare glucose for fetal use, is secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts (not granulosa cells), and pregnancy tests detect hCG (not hCS)."

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Pregnancy does NOT increase lung volumes and capacities; in fact, the upward displacement of the diaphragm by the enlarged uterus actually REDUCES lung volumes. All other options are correct maternal adaptations: GFR increases by 50-60%, plasma volume increases by 40-50%, cardiac output increases by 30-50%, and while red blood cell mass increases, the relative hemodilution can give the appearance of decreased erythropoiesis."

Physical examination revealed a tall female with a short, blind-ended vagina and no palpable cervix. Ultrasound showed the absence of a uterus and no ovaries and the presence of undescended testes. Deficiency of which enzyme, hormone, or receptor is most likely to account for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "Androgen receptors",
      "Aromatase",
      "Estrogen receptors",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This describes complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (testicular feminization). The patient has a 46,XY karyotype with testes that produce testosterone and MIS normally. However, due to androgen receptor deficiency, the body cannot respond to androgens, leading to female external genitalia development. MIS from Sertoli cells causes regression of Müllerian structures (uterus, fallopian tubes), resulting in a blind vaginal pouch. The testes remain undescended, and patients are tall due to delayed epiphyseal closure from lack of androgen effects."

      "Day 14",
      "Day 21",
      "Day 28"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Day 21 corresponds to the mid-luteal phase when the corpus luteum is fully functional, secreting high levels of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin. These hormones exert strong negative feedback on the pituitary, suppressing FSH and LH secretion. This hormonal profile is characteristic of the luteal phase and essential for preparing the endometrium for potential implantation."

    "question": "A 37-year-old woman who is breast-feeding her 4-month-old son is taking the train to see her mother who lives several hours away. When the woman hears the cry of another infant, she notices that milk has been expressed from both her breasts. The release of which hormone can account for this response?",
    "options": [
      "Estrogen",
      "Inhibin",
      "Oxytocin",
      "Progesterone",
      "Prolactin"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Oxytocin is responsible for milk ejection (let-down reflex) by causing contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding breast alveoli. This reflex can be conditioned by various stimuli including infant crying, thinking about the baby, or emotional states. Prolactin is responsible for milk production (lactogenesis), not milk ejection."

    "question": "A 36-year-old woman who is pregnant with her third child is in labor. Her serum oxytocin levels were measured at regular intervals over a 24-hour period. Measurements were taken at the onset when the woman began having low back pains 1 day before delivery and ended 3 hours after delivery of the infant, just before the woman was to begin breast-feeding the infant. A normal vaginal delivery was completed without medical intervention. At what time was the oxytocin concentration in maternal blood most likely to be highest?",

      "Three hours after delivery"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Oxytocin levels peak during the expulsive stage of labor when the fetus descends and cervical dilation is maximal. This creates a positive feedback loop: cervical stretching stimulates oxytocin release, which causes stronger uterine contractions, leading to more cervical stretching. This Ferguson reflex ensures progressive labor until delivery."

      "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone",
      "Inhibin",
      "Progesterone"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Sustained high levels of estrogen from the developing dominant follicle switch from negative to positive feedback on the pituitary around mid-cycle. This positive feedback sensitizes gonadotropes to GnRH, triggering the LH surge that induces ovulation. This is a unique neuroendocrine phenomenon specific to the menstrual cycle."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Day 14 corresponds to ovulation when estrogen levels peak. Under estrogen dominance, cervical mucus becomes thin, watery, and alkaline, forming a fern-like crystallization pattern when dried. This facilitates sperm transport and survival. Progesterone-dominated mucus (luteal phase) is thick and does not fern."

    "explanation": "Vasectomy involves cutting and sealing the vas deferens, preventing sperm transport from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts. Semen (composed of secretions from seminal vesicles, prostate, and Cowper's glands) is still ejaculated, but it contains no sperm. Sperm production continues but sperm are phagocytosed in the epididymis."

      "Luteinizing hormone receptor",
      "5a-Reductase",
      "Testosterone"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "5α-reductase deficiency impairs conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is essential for normal development of external male genitalia (penis, scrotum, prostate). At puberty, high testosterone levels can partially overcome this deficiency, leading to virilization (phallic growth, muscle development, voice deepening) as testosterone can bind androgen receptors, though less effectively than DHT."

The cells failed to secrete significant amounts of estrogen when exposed to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) until they were cultured together with ovarian thecal cells. A likely explanation for the failure of granulosa cells to produce estrogens when cultured alone is",
    "options": [

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Estrogen synthesis requires the two-cell system: Theca interna cells (under LH stimulation) produce androgens from cholesterol. These androgens diffuse to granulosa cells, where FSH-stimulated aromatase converts them to estrogens. Granulosa cells lack the enzymes for de novo androgen synthesis but are rich in aromatase. Without thecal cell-derived androgens, granulosa cells cannot produce significant estrogen."

    "explanation": "This describes true precocious puberty. Early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis leads to premature sex steroid production, causing an early growth spurt and advanced bone age. However, early epiphyseal closure results in short adult stature. The history of early pubic/axillary hair development and initially being taller than peers, followed by short adult height, is characteristic of precocious puberty with premature growth plate fusion."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The temperature of the testes must be considerably below that of the internal body temperature for spermatogenesis to occur. The testes are normally maintained at a temperature of about 32°C, and are kept cool by a countercurrent heat exchange between the spermatic arteries and veins and by air circulating around the scrotum. The testes develop in the abdomen but normally descend into the scrotum during fetal development. In ~10% of newborn males, one or, less commonly, both testes remain in the abdominal cavity or inguinal canal. Although most (98%) of undescended testes (cryptorchidism) spontaneously descend by 1 year, and all but 0.3% spontaneously descend by puberty, early surgical treatment is recommended because abdominal temperatures can cause irreversible damage to the spermatogenic epithelium and the incidence of malignant tumors is higher in undesecnded than in scrotal testes. Maturation of spermatogonia, the primitive germ cells, into primary spermatocytes does not begin until adolescence. Throughout the reproductive life of the human male, 100 to 200 million sperm are produced daily. Of critical importance to the hormonal regulation of spermatogenesis are the pulsatile release of GRH and the subsequent involvement of FSH and LH at their target cells. FSH acts directly on the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules to initiate mitotic and meiotic activity of germ cells. LH effects are thought to be mediated via stimulation of testosterone secretion by the Leydig cells."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Prolactin is a single-chain protein structurally homologous to growth hormone, which is secreted by the anterior pituitary and has the principal physiologic effects of lactation (i.e., milk production), decreased reproductive function, and suppressed sexual drive. Normal adult serum levels of prolactin are about the same or only slightly higher in females compared to males. Consistent with its role in lactogenesis, prolactin secretion increases during pregnancy. Suckling increases prolactin secretion, but milk ejection during suckling is due to oxytocin release. Prolactin inhibits reproductive function by inhibiting hypothalamic GnRH release and pituitary gonadotropin secretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both males and females. Pregnancy and lactation are the most important physiological causes of hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, hypothyroidism, and drug-induced inhibition or disruption of dopaminergic receptor function are other common causes of hyperprolactinemia."

      "FSH",
      "GnRH",
      "Estrogen",
      "Progesterone"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Ovulation is caused by a sudden increase in LH secretion. Both LH and FSH blood levels increase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and reach peak blood levels prior to ovulation. Estrogen levels follow a similar pattern during the follicular phase. The physiological signal for ovulation is a surge in LH blood levels. Under the influence of LH, thecal and granulosa cells become the luteal cells of the corpus luteum. Progesterone production by the corpus luteum increases significantly. Estrogen levels also increase, but do not reach the levels achieved during the follicular phase. In anorexia nervosa, the regulation of virtually every endocrine system is altered, but the most striking changes occur in the reproductive system. Amenorrhea in anorexia nervosa is hypothalamic in origin and reflects decreased production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (with low levels of LH and FSH) that may be due to a marked reduction in leptin associated with the decreased mass of adipose tissue. In up to 25% of patients, however, amenorrhea precedes significant weight loss."

    "explanation": "Ovulation occurs at point A on the graph. In response to estrogen secretion by the ovary, the endometrial lining of the uterus undergoes proliferation of both glandular epithelium and supporting stroma during the first 10 to 14 days of the menstrual cycle. Following ovulation, the glands begin to secrete mucus and the stroma undergoes pseudodecidual reaction in preparation for potential pregnancy. When ovulation is not followed by implantation of a fertilized ovum, progesterone secretion declines as the corpus luteum involutes, and the endometrial lining is almost completely shed during menses."

Progesterone affects the set point for thermoregulation and increases body temperature approximately 0.58°F. Both LH and FSH blood levels increase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and reach peak blood levels prior to ovulation. Estrogen levels follow a similar pattern during the follicular phase. The physiologic signal for ovulation is a surge in LH blood levels.

    "explanation": "The Sertoli cells rest on a basal lamina and form a layer around the periphery of the seminiferous tubules. They are attached to each other by specialized junctional complexes that limit the movement of fluid and solute molecules from the interstitial space and blood to the tubular lumen, and thus form a blood-testis barrier that provides an immunologically privileged environment for sperm maturation. Sertoli cells are intimately associated with developing spermatozoa and play a major role in germ-cell maturation. They secrete a variety of serum proteins and an androgen-binding protein into the tubular fluid in response to FSH and testosterone stimulation. Testosterone is synthesized and secreted by the interstitial Leydig cells. Estrogen is produced in small amounts by the Sertoli cells before puberty."

    "explanation": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) begins to appear in the maternal blood approximately 6 to 8 days following ovulation, upon implantation of the fertilized ovum in the endometrium. The secretion of hCG is essential to prevent involution of the corpus luteum and to stimulate secretion of progesterone and estrogens, which continues until the placenta becomes large enough to secrete sufficient quantities of those hormones. Following a peak at 7 to 9 weeks, hCG secretion gradually declines to a low level by 20 weeks gestation."

    "explanation": "A combined neurogenic and hormonal reflex involving oxytocin, a posterior pituitary hormone, causes the actual ejection (\"let-down\") of milk from breast tissue. Although estrogen and progesterone are essential for the physical development of breast tissue during pregnancy, both hormones inhibit milk secretion. Milk secretion is regulated by prolactin, a pituitary hormone secreted throughout pregnancy and after parturition. Adequate amounts of growth hormone are required to provide the nutrients that are essential for milk production by breast tissue. Suckling on breast tissue is the stimulus that leads to milk secretion. The secretion of oxytocin is increased by stressful stimuli, and inhibited by alcohol. Furthermore, alcohol is transferred from the mother's bloodstream into her breast milk and to the nursing infant, where it can have many deleterious effects."

      "Is inhibited by secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Implantation of a zygote into the uterine wall involves infiltration of the endometrium by the syncytiotrophoblast. Fertilization and early cleavage of the zygote occur in the fallopian tube in the human female. After approximately 3 days, the zygote enters the uterine cavity, where it undergoes additional divisions over a period of 3 to 4 days to form a morula of approximately 60 cells that is transformed into a blastocyst consisting of the yolk sac and embryo. Enzymatic digestion of the zona pellucida and infiltration of the endometrium by the syncytiotrophoblast, which forms the outer layer of the blastocyst, result in implantation of the blastocyst within the endometrium, where it erodes into maternal vessels. During these early stages of embryogenesis, the endometrium is primed by progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum in the ovary in response to pituitary gonadotropin secretion. After 10 to 15 days, placental gonadotropins maintain the corpus luteum until placental synthesis of progesterone is established at 6 to 8 weeks of gestation. Large dose estrogens, diethystilbesterol, and mifepristone (RU486) are examples of postcoital contraceptives."

    "explanation": "Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum. The plasma level of progesterone is low during the menses and remains low until just prior to ovulation. It rises substantially after ovulation, owing to secretion by the corpus luteum. If fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone until the placenta develops and begins to produce large amounts of the hormone.

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The testosterone metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induces the formation of the male external genitalia and male secondary sex characteristics. The fetus develops with bipotential internal and external genitalia that can develop (at about 40 days gestation) into either a testis or ovary, depending upon which genes are expressed. When the embryo has functional testes, male internal and external genitalia develop. The Leydig cells of the fetal testis secrete testosterone and the Sertoli cells secrete milleframinhibiting substance (MIS), also known as antimüllerian hormone (AMH), a member of the TGF-β growth factor family. The development of male internal genitalia depends upon testosterone, which stimulates growth and development of the Wolfflam ducts and MIS, which stimulates Müllerian duct regression. Individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome have an XXY chromosomal pattern, which is the most common sex chromosome disorder. These individuals have internal and external male genitalia, and testosterone secretion at puberty is often great enough for the development of male characteristics. However, the testes are small and the seminiferous tubules are abnormal, leading to infertility, ennuchoid proportions, gynecomastia, and poor virilization in phenotypic males. Mental retardation, developmental delay, or learning disabilities may be present. Patients with mosaic forms of Klinefelter's syndrome have less severe clinical features, larger testes, and may achieve fertility."

      "Insulin",

Its effect on the breast involves increased action of mRNA and increased production of casein and lactalbumin, but the hormone action is not exerted on the cell nucleus. The actions of progesterone are prevented by inhibitors of microtubules. Oxytocin is a posterior pituitary peptide that promotes contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding breast ducts and causes expulsion of milk from lobular alveoli. Secretion of oxytocin is promoted by tactile stimulation of the breast by the nursing infant. It can also be elicited by psychic factors alone, such as the anticipation of nursing brought on by hearing the cry of the hungry infant. This anticipatory secretion of oxytocin may be experienced by the mother as a sensation of milk letdown in which milk appears at the nipple and may be forcibly ejected."

In both observational studies and randomized trials, hormone therapy (either estrogen alone or estrogen/progestin) shows definite improvement in vasomotor symptoms (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and vaginal dryness, and in increasing bone density and reducing the risk of fractures. However, observational studies promoting the use of hormone therapy as a strategy to delay the postmenopausal onset of cardiovascular disease have recently been refuted by randomized trials showing an increased risk of coronary artery disease in stroke with hormone replacement therapy. Hormone therapy also increases the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer (with long-term use), venous thromboembolism, and gallbladder disease. Estrogen therapy does not restore a woman's ability to have children."

    "question": "Which one of the following statements about semen is correct?",
    "options": [
      "The bulk of semen volume is contributed by the prostate gland",
      "Semen prevents sperm capacitation",
      "Semen is propelled out of the urethra by contraction of the smooth muscle comprising the bulbocavernosus muscle.",
      "Semen activates sperm motility in the male reproductive tract",
      "In the population, sperm counts in semen have increased over the last 20 years"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Semen contains chemicals that prevent sperm capacitation, thereby prolonging the viability of the sperm. In addition, the high potassium content of the secretion inhibits sperm motility, further adding to the viability. Semen is secreted primarily by the seminiferous tubules and the alkaline nature of the secretion buffers the acidity of the vagina. In recent years, the average sperm count has decreased from approximately 100 million/mL of semen to 60 to 70 million/mL of semen. The bulbocavernosus muscle is a skeletal muscle."

    "question": "Prolactin secretion is tonically suppressed in nonpregnant women by which of the following hormones?",
    "options": [
      "Estrogen",
      "Progesterone",
      "Dopamine",
      "FSH",
      "LH"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "In non-pregnant women, the secretion of prolactin is kept tonically suppressed by secretion of dopamine from the hypothalamus. Prolactin is the main hormone of lactation. Hormone levels increase early in pregnancy due to the influence of estrogens. However, lactation does not occur early in pregnancy because estrogens and progesterone inhibit the interaction of prolactin with receptors located on the alveolar cell membranes. At term, estrogen and progesterone levels decrease and milk production begins usually within 3 days of delivery."

    "question": "A young couple has been trying to conceive a baby. The Medical Director of the Fertility Center has advised the woman to take her basal temperature readings on a daily basis and for them to have intercourse at the time the woman appears to be ovulating. Once conception takes place, which of the following must occur in order for the pregnancy to proceed uneventfully?",
    "options": [
      "The corpus luteum must secrete progesterone to sustain the endometrium.",
      "The pituitary must secrete hCG to maintain the corpus luteum.",
      "The pituitary must secrete prolactin to sustain the placenta.",
      "The placenta must secrete FSH to maintain ovarian function.",
      "The placenta must secrete LH to maintain ovarian function."
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The corpus luteum in the ovary at the time of fertilization fails to regress and instead enlarges in response to stimulation by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secreted by the placenta. During the first trimester, placental production of hCG sustains the corpus luteum and ensures continued progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum, which is essential for development of the fetus."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents at her physician's office complaining of nausea and vomiting. The history reveals that her symptoms have been present for over a month and that they seem to be worse in the morning. A urine sample is taken and shows that the woman is pregnant. Physiological changes that occur during pregnancy include which of the following?",

      "Hypercapnia",
      "Increased hematocrit",
      "Reduced circulating gonadotropin levels"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "During pregnancy, the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary axis is suppressed due to high circulating levels of sex hormones. This leads to reduced gonadotropin levels, and, thus, ovulation does not occur. Additionally, hyperventilation leads to decreased arterial carbon dioxide levels. Increased water retention leads to decreased hematocrit. Maternal use of glucose declines and, as a result, glu-concogenesis increases. Plasma cortisol levels increase as the result of progesterone-mediated displacement from transcortin and its subsequent binding to globulin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents at her obstetrician/gynecologist's office for her annual well-woman examination. She reports that she may have 'a touch of the flu' because she has been tired and nauseated the past week and also has had fleeting episodes of lower abdominal pain. She wasn't sure when her last menstrual period started but after looking at a calendar, realized that it had been 38 days. A right adnexal mass was palpated on routine pelvic examination and subsequently observed on ultrasound. Urinalysis confirmed that the woman was pregnant and serum levels of the tumor marker CA-125 were elevated. The gynecologist informed the woman that she may have to have her ovary removed, but that they need to wait another week or two to do the laparotomy in order to protect her fetus. Ovarectomy before the sixth week of pregnancy leads to abortion, but thereafter has no effect on pregnancy because the placenta secretes adequate amounts of which of the following hormones?",

            "correct": 3,
            "explanation": "During pregnancy, high levels of estrogen and progesterone inhibit the action of prolactin on the breast, preventing lactation. After delivery, these hormone levels drop, allowing prolactin to promote milk production. Prolactin levels are actually high during pregnancy but are ineffective due to steroid hormone opposition."

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin secretion is stimulated by dilation of the cervix during labor (Ferguson reflex) and by suckling during lactation. Milk ejection is a result of oxytocin action, not a cause. Prolactin stimulates milk production but not oxytocin release. ECF volume and osmolarity affect ADH, not oxytocin."

            "correct": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated serum testosterone is due to lack of androgen receptors on the anterior pituitary, which normally mediate negative feedback by testosterone. Without functional receptors, testosterone cannot suppress gonadotropin secretion, leading to high testosterone levels. The 46 XY genotype and testes are due to genetic factors, while lack of uterus and cervix is from anti-Müllerian hormone secretion by fetal testes."
