            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Lipids are transported in the blood complexed to proteins called apo-lipoproteins. Abnormalities of this lipid transport or metabolism result in hyperlipoproteinemias, which are responsible for most syndromes of premature atherosclerosis. The primary hyperlipidemias are divided into five distinct electrophoretic patterns. Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, caused by a mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene, results in increased chylomicrons and triglycerides. Type II hyperlipoproteinemia, perhaps the most frequent Mendelian disorder, is caused by a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. This results in increased LDL and cholesterol. Homozygotes for this gene defect have markedly increased plasma cholesterol levels and develop severe atherosclerosis at an early age. Xanthomas of the Achilles tendon are somewhat specific for this disorder. Mutations in the apolipoprotein E gene result in type III hyperlipoproteinemia, which is characterized by increased intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), triglycerides, and cholesterol. Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia causes increased very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and triglycerides. The genetic defect causing this abnormality is a mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene. Type V hyperlipoproteinemia, caused by a mutation in apolipoprotein CII, results in increased VLDLs, chylomicrons, triglycerides, and cholesterol."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Increased serum lipids (hyperlipidemia) may be a primary genetic defect or may be secondary to another disorder, such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, the nephrotic syndrome, or hypothyroidism. Secondary hypertriglyceridemia in patients with diabetes mellitus usually occurs secondary to increased blood levels of VLDL. The reason for this is that with decreased levels of insulin with diabetes mellitus there is increased mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (increased lipolysis). This increases delivery of free fatty acids to the liver, which increases production and secretion of VLDL by the liver. This is a type IV hyperlipidemia pattern. Ethanol can also produce a type IV pattern due to increased VLDL. This is because ethanol also increases lipolysis of adipose tissue, which increases delivery of free fatty acids to the liver. Ethanol also increases the esterification of fatty acid to triglycerides in the liver and inhibits the release of lipoproteins from the liver."

            explanation: "There are various risk factors that predispose individuals to the development of atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. These risk factors are either quite significant (major factors) or less significant (minor factors). Major factors include diet and hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia), hypertension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Minor risk factors include obesity, lack of physical exercise, male gender, stress, oral contraceptives (birth control pills), and hyperhomocystinemia. Another minor risk factor is the presence in the serum of lipoprotein(a), which is an altered form of LDL, that contains the apoprotein B100 linked to apoprotein(a). This special type of apoprotein has structural homology to plasminogen. These similar areas are called kringles because they resemble a type of Danish pastry. It is thought that, because of the similarity of structure, Lp(a) competes with plasminogen in clots and decreases the ability to form plasmin and clear clots."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis depends in part on the inflammatory function of macrophages, which involves the release of numerous cytokines. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is mitogenic and chemotactic for smooth-muscle cells. This may explain the recruitment and proliferation of smooth-muscle cells in atherosclerosis. Other macrophage products participate in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis by other means. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transform the normally anticoagulant endothelial surface into a procoagulant surface by stimulating endothelial cells to produce platelet-activating factor (PAF), tissue factor (TF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). Interferon alpha and transforming growth factor beta inhibit cell proliferation. This could explain the failure of endothelial cells to repair endothelial defects. These defects could then either provide entry areas for lipoproteins and plasma-derived factors or serve as an area where thrombi are formed."

            explanation: "Hypertension is associated with two forms of damage to small blood vessels: hyaline arteriolosclerosis and hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis, which is also a vascular complication of patients with diabetes mellitus, is presumably caused by leakage of plasma components across the endothelium. Microscopic examination will reveal the lumens of small arterioles to be narrowed by homogenous pink (hyaline) deposits in the walls. These changes within the kidney are referred to as benign nephrosclerosis, in which the decreased blood supply causes loss of nephrons and a characteristic finely granular appearance to the kidney surface. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is associated with benign hypertension. In contrast, hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis is associated with malignant hypertension, which refers to dramatic elevations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure often resulting in early death from cerebral and brainstem hemorrhages. Pathologically, the renal vessels demonstrate a concentric obliteration of arterioles by an increase in smooth-muscle cells and protein deposition in a laminar configuration (onionskining) that includes fibrin material, which leads to total and subtotal occlusion of the vessels. These changes are called hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. Medial calcific sclerosis (Mnckeberg’s arteriosclerosis) is characterized by dystrophic calcification in the tunica media of muscular arteries. There is no narrowing of the lumen of the affected vessels. Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s disease) is occlusion by a proliferative inflammatory process in arteries of heavy cigarette smokers and is often associated with HLA-A9,B5 genotypes. Finally, the term “arteriosclerosis obliterans” refers to arteriosclerosis of the extremities (peripheral vascular disease)."

This pattern is seen in patients with microscopic PAN or idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis without systemic disease. Microscopic PAN commonly involves glomerular and pulmonary capillaries and may produce hematuria, hemoptysis, and renal failure. Histologic sections reveal segmental fibrinoid necrosis.

The differential diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis includes microscopic PAN and three other disorders: Henoch-Schnlein purpura, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Henoch-Schnlein purpura is a disorder of children who present with hemorrhagic urticaria and hematuria following an upper respiratory infection. The pathology of this disease involves the deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in small vessels of the skin. Because the antibody is IgA, the alternate complement pathway is activated in these patients. Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) is characterized by acute necrotizing granulomas of the upper and lower respiratory tract, focal necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels, and renal disease. Histologically there is fibrinoid necrosis of small arteries, early infiltration by neutrophils, and granuloma formation with giant cells. The peak incidence is in the fifth decade, and many patients have C-ANCAs. The disease is highly fatal, with death occurring within 1 year, unless recognized and treated with immunosuppressive agents.

It used to be found exclusively in men, but recently there has been an increase in the number of reported cases in women. The vessels primarily affected are in the extremities, and this leads to painful ischemia and gangrene of the legs and arms due to thrombosis. Histologic sections reveal an acute inflammatory infiltrate involving the entire wall of the vessel. In contrast to atherosclerosis, small microabscesses may be seen within thrombi. The inflammation leads to intimal proliferation that obliterates the lumen and causes pain. The disease may regress on cessation of smoking. In contrast, granulomatous inflammation with giant cells involving blood vessels can be seen with temporal arteritis or Takayasu’s arteritis.

            explanation: "An aneurysm is an abnormal dilation of any vessel. The causes of aneurysms are many, but the two most important ones are atherosclerosis and cystic medial necrosis. Atherosclerotic aneurysms, the most common type of aortic aneurysms, usually occur distal to the renal arteries and proximal to the bifurcation of the aorta. Many atherosclerotic aneurysms are asymptomatic, but if they rupture they produce sudden, severe abdominal pain, shock, and a risk of death. Prior to rupture, physical examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Cystic medial necrosis refers to the focal loss of elastic and muscle fibers in the media of vessels and is seen in patients with hypertension, dissecting aneurysms, and Marfan’s syndrome. Trauma may also lead to the formation of dissecting aneurysms. Berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of arteries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms are caused by obliterative endarteritis of the vasa vasorum of the aorta. These aneurysms are part of the tertiary manifestation of syphilis and become evident 15 to 20 years after persons have contracted the initial infection with Treponema pallidum. Elastic tissue and smooth-muscle cells of the media undergo ischemic destruction as a result of the treponemal infection (obliterative endarteritis). As a consequence of ischemia in the media, musculoelastic support is lost and fibrosis occurs. Grossly, the aorta has a “tree-bark” appearance. Luetic aneurysms almost always occur in the thoracic aorta and may lead to luetic heart disease by producing insufficiency of the aortic valve (aortic regurgitation)."

            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Dissecting aneurysms are usually the result of cystic medial necrosis of the aorta. This abnormality results from loss of elastic tissue in the media and is associated with hypertension and Marfan’s syndrome. Most cases of dissecting aneurysms involve a transverse tear in the intima and are located in the ascending aorta, just above the aortic ring. The pain caused by a dissecting aneurysm is similar to the pain caused by a myocardial infarction, but it extends into the abdomen as the dissection progresses. Additionally, the blood pressure is not decreased with a dissecting aneurysm unless the aorta itself has ruptured. In contrast, berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of arteries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Rupture of these aneurysms may produce a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Berry aneurysms have been noted in about one-sixth of patients with adult polycystic renal disease and account for death in about 10% of patients with this type of polycystic renal disease. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms occur in the thoracic aorta and may lead to luetic heart disease by producing insufficiency of the aortic valve. Mycotic (infectious) aneurysms result from microbial infection during septicemia, usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis. They are prone to rupture and hemorrhage. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of eight syndromes characterized by defects in collagen synthesis. In EDS IV there is deficient synthesis of type III collagen and a tendency to rupture of muscular arteries, including dissecting aneurysms of the aorta."

Histologically they reveal dilated vessels lined by endothelial cells, but they lack red blood cells in their lumen. The absence of red blood cells helps to distinguish these lesions from hemangiomas. Cystic hygromas are cystic lymphangiomas that typically occur in the neck or axilla. They may grow to such a large size that the neck is deformed. These lesions may be found in patients with Turner’s syndrome, an abnormality that results from complete or partial monosomy for the X chromosome. Swelling of the neck in these individuals occurs because of dilated lymphatic vessels. With time the swelling decreases, but patients may develop bilateral neck webbing and loose skin on the back of the neck. In contrast, dilated blood vessels (vascular ectasia) may be congenital or acquired. “Birthmarks” may be caused by congenital vascular ectasia (nevus flammeus) or capillary hemangiomas. “Port-wine stains” are similar lesions that may be caused by vascular ectasia or cavernous hemangiomas of the skin. Spider angiomas are acquired vascular ectasias that are the result of increased estrogen levels. They are associated with pregnancy and liver disease. Bacillary angiomatosis is a nonneoplastic proliferation of blood vessels that is found in immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with AIDS. Histologically, there are proliferating capillaries that are lined by protuberant endothelial cells. Additionally, numerous neutrophils are present along with nuclear dust and purple granules. These latter granules are Rickettsia-like bacteria that are the cause of this lesion, which responds to erythromycin."

It occurs in older men of Eastern European or Mediterranean origin (predominantly Italian or Jewish) and is characterized by purple maculopapular skin lesions of the lower extremities and visceral involvement in only 10% of cases. The African form occurs in younger people and is more aggressive; it often involves lymph nodes in children. The rare form in immunosuppressed recipients of renal transplants often regresses when immunosuppression stops. In the epidemic form associated with AIDS, skin lesions may occur anywhere and disseminate to the mucous membranes, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lymph nodes, and viscera. Histologic determination is difficult, but all four clinical types appear similar. In the early stages, irregular, dilated epidermal vascular spaces, extravasated red cells, and hemosiderin are characteristic. This histologic appearance is very similar to that of granulation tissue or stasis dermatitis. Later in the disease process, more characteristic lesions show spindle cells around slit spaces with extravasation of erythrocytes. In contrast, irregular vascular spaces lined by nests of uniform cells describe the histologic appearance of a glomus tumor, while multiple dilated endothelial-lined vessels that lack red blood cells describe the histologic appearance of lymphangiomas. Numerous neutrophils, nuclear dust, and purple granules characterize bacillary angiomatosis, while proliferating blood vessels, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts suggest granulation tissue."

            correct: 2,
            explanation: "The heart will eventually fail to maintain cardiac output if it is forced to work in an abnormal state for a prolonged period of time. The symptoms produced by congestive heart failure relate to whether the failure involves the left side of the heart or the right side of the heart. Symptoms of acute left ventricular failure include pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hypoxia, while chronic left ventricular failure will produce dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea (trouble breathing when lying down), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and eventually right heart failure. There are many causes of congestive heart failure, but basically they produce either systolic dysfunction or diastolic dysfunction. Systolic dysfunction may result from increased preload, increased afterload, or decreased contractility. Causes of increased preload (volume overload) include regurgitation (mitral and aortic regurgitation), anemia, hyperthyroidism, and beriberi. Note that diseases with increased cardiac output, such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, and beriberi, are classified as high-output failure diseases. In contrast, diseases that decrease cardiac output are called low-output failure diseases. Causes of increased afterload (pressure overload) include hypertension, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Decreased contractility can result from myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, drugs, and certain infections. Diastolic dysfunction results from decreased filling of the ventricles during diastole. Examples of this include mitral stenosis, infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis, and constrictive pericardial diseases."

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "One of the consequences of myocardial ischemia is chest pain, which is called angina. Angina is caused by a mismatch between the myocardial oxygen demand and the myocardial blood flow. There are three main types of angina. Typical angina (stable angina) is the most common type and is characterized by pain that results from exercise, stress, or excitement. The pain is promptly relieved by rest (which decreases oxygen demand) or nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is converted to nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator that increases perfusion to the heart. ECG changes in patients with stable angina are nonspecific and include T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression, which occurs secondary to ischemia of the subendocardium of the left ventricle. The second type of angina, Prinzmetal’s angina (atypical angina), is caused by coronary artery vasospasm and is characterized by pain occurring at rest. This pain may be relieved by calcium channel blockers or nitroglycerin. ECG in these patients reveals ST-segment elevation, which is the result of transmural ischemia. The third type of angina is unstable angina, which is characterized by increasing frequency of pain, increased duration of pain, or pain that is produced by less physical exertion. This final type of angina indicates that a myocardial infarction (MI) may be near, most likely due to the formation of a thrombus over an area of coronary artery atherosclerosis. In contrast to an MI, with angina there is no actual necrosis (infarction) of myocardial tissue, and therefore there are no increased cardiac enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), in the serum. Also, the pain of angina is not made worse with deep inspiration, a sign that is suggestive of pleural disease."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "The clinical diagnosis of MI depends on correlating clinical symptoms, ECG findings, and serum cardiac enzyme changes. The classic description of the pain produced by an MI is crushing, substernal pain that may radiate down the patient’s left arm. This pain may be associated with sweating, nausea, and vomiting. ECG findings associated with MI include ST-segment elevation (which may return to normal), inverted T waves, and abnormal Q waves. Serum enzymes that may be elevated after an MI include troponin, CPK, SGOT (AST), and LDH, which are increased temporally in that order. The troponin complex is made up of three protein subunits: troponin I (Tn-I), troponin T, and troponin C. There are three isoforms of Tn-I: two in skeletal muscle and one in cardiac muscle (cTn-I). cTn-I levels begin to increase 4 to 6 h after the onset of chest pain, reach maximal serum concentration in about 12 to 24 h, and remain elevated for about 3 to 10 days. CPK exists in three isoenzymes, MM, MB, and BB, where M stands for muscle and B stands for brain. Elevation of the CPK MB isoenzyme is seen following an MI. Levels begin to rise at 4 to 8 h, peak at 12 to 24 h, and return to normal in 3 to 4 days. LDH exists in five isoenzyme forms. Normally serum LDH2 is greater than LDH1, but following an MI this ratio is flipped, that is, LDH1 is greater than LDH2. LDH1 levels begin to rise at 10 to 12 h, peak at 2 to 3 days, and return to normal in 7 to 10 days. New cardiac markers use monoclonal antibodies directed against myoglobin, CK-MB mass assay, and cardiac troponin levels. Myoglobin is a small monomer with a rapid rise and fall in serum (narrow window) that may be used to test the effect of “clot-busting” drugs, especially with rapid serial detection."

Most cases of STEMI are caused by thrombosis of a coronary artery overlying a previously stable atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerosis, however, does not affect the coronary arteries equally. Generally atherosclerosis affects the proximal 2 cm of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex artery, and the proximal and distal one-third of the right coronary artery. Anterior infarcts (such as infarction of the anterior left ventricle) result from occlusion of the LAD, as this artery normally supplies the anterior left ventricle, the apex, and the anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum. About 10% of transmural myocardial infarcts (STEMIs) are not caused by thrombosis overlying an atherosclerotic plaque. Less frequent causes of MI in these cases include coronary artery vasospasm (sometimes seen in association with cocaine use), coronary artery embolism (possibly in association with atrial fibrillation), coronary arteritis, or deposition of amyloid in the walls of the coronary arteries."

            explanation: "Areas of myocardial infarction (MI) undergo a series of changes that consists of typical ischemic coagulative necrosis followed by inflammation and repair. MIs less than 6 to 12 h old are not apparent on gross examination. By 12 to 24 h, there is pallor in the area of infarction, which is due to the trapped blood. On days 1 to 3, grossly the infarct develops a hyperemic (red) border and then becomes pale yellow over the next several days (days 4 to 7). By 7 to 14 days, the area of necrosis is surrounded by a hyperemic red-purple border of highly vascularized granulation tissue. Over the next few weeks, the area of necrosis changes to a gray-white fibrotic scar. Electron microscopic (EM) changes in MI can be seen at 20 to 40 min, but routine histologic changes are first seen at 1 to 3 h. These EM findings consist of signs of reversible injury (mitochondrial swelling and distortion of cristae) and signs of irreversible injury (mitochondrial amorphous densities called flocculent densities). The earliest histologic change is the formation of wavy fibers. These wavy fibers result from the pulling of the noncontractile necrotic fibers by adjacent viable fibers. Histologic features of coagulation necrosis are seen at 12 to 24 h. An acute inflammatory response consisting mainly of neutrophils is most pronounced on days 2 to 3, while macrophages predominate during days 4 to 7. The ingrowth of highly vascularized granulation tissue begins around day 7 and is maximal at 2 to 4 weeks. Note that at about days 4 to 10 the infarcted tissue becomes quite soft, and there is a risk of cardiac rupture. These events within the first few weeks are followed by scarring (fibrosis), which is well developed by the sixth week and is irreversible."

It occurs usually within the first week of infarction, when there is maximal necrosis and softening (4 to 5 days) and is very rare after the second week. Rupture of the free wall results in pericardial hemorrhage and cardiac tamponade. Rupture of the interventricular septum causes a left-to-right shunt. Serious mitral valve incompetence results from rupture of anterior or posterior papillary muscles. This valve incompetence can produce signs of mitral regurgitation, including a new pansystolic murmur along with a diastolic flow murmur. Indeed, the onset of a new murmur following a MI should raise the possibility of papillary rupture. Other common complications of MI include arrhythmias such as heart block, sinus arrhythmias, or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. These occur in 90% of complicated cases. Next in importance, but not in frequency (only 10%), is cardiogenic shock from severe left ventricular contractile incompetence. Milder left ventricular failure with lung edema occurs in 60% of these cases, while mural thrombosis with peripheral emboli may occur in up to 40%.

ECG changes and pulsus paradoxus are also present. Pericarditis developing after a myocardial infarct is usually either serous or serofibrinous.

Systemic HHD is the result of systemic hypertension, which causes left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. There is by definition no other cardiac disease present that could cause LV hypertrophy, such as aortic stenosis. Hypertension is a pressure overload on the heart, and as such it causes concentric LV hypertrophy without dilation. This type of hypertrophy is characterized by a parallel deposition of sarcomeres. Histologic sections may show myocytes with hyperchromatic and rectangular (“box-car”) nuclei. In contrast, eccentric hypertrophy is the result of volume overload on the heart. In systemic HHD the LV is stiff, as there is decreased LV compliance. Pulmonary HHD refers to right ventricular hypertrophy that is the result of pulmonary disease. By definition, this type of heart disease is called cor pulmonale.

            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Aortic stenosis (AS) is usually the result of a bicuspid aortic valve (AV), degenerative calcification of a bicuspid valve, or rheumatic heart disease. Patients with aortic stenosis may present with angina (chest pain), syncopal episodes with exertion, and heart failure. Angina results from the mismatch between increased oxygen demand of the hypertrophied left ventricle (LV) and decreased blood flow, while syncope results from the inability to increase stroke volume as necessary with a stenotic AV. AS is the most common valvular disease that is associated with angina and syncope. The characteristic heart murmur of AS is a crescendo-decrescendo midsystolic ejection murmur that has a paradoxically split S2. In order to pump the blood into the aorta across a stenotic AV, the pressure in the LV must be much greater than the resultant pressure in the aorta. In order to produce this increased pressure, the LV undergoes concentric hypertrophy, which increases contractility. This concentric hypertrophy also makes the wall of the LV stiffer (decreased compliance). This stiff LV is unable to dilate until the time the LV starts to fail."

Owing to the rapidly falling arterial pressure during late systole and diastole, there is often wide pulse pressure, Corrigan’s “water-hammer” pulse, capillary pulsations at the nail beds, and a pistol-shot sound over the femoral arteries. A blowing diastolic murmur is heard along the left sternal border. Volume overload of the heart is the basic defect and results in left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy. AR is rheumatic in origin in approximately 70% of cases. Much less frequently it is due to syphilis, ankylosing spondylitis (rarely), infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, or aortic dilation from cystic medial necrosis. Congenital forms of aortic stenosis occur fairly frequently, but AR is rarely congenital in origin."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "The normal mitral valve (MV) is a bicuspid valve with the anterior cusp approximately twice the area of the posterior cusp. The MV area is normally 5 to 6 cm². Clinically significant mitral stenosis (MS) usually results when the valve area decreases to less than 1 cm². MS most commonly develops as a consequence of rheumatic heart disease. It may also develop due to congenital abnormalities or calcium deposition. In patients with MS there is decreased flow across the MV due to the stenosis of the valve. In order to move the blood into the left ventricle (LV), the left atrial (LA) pressure during diastole is greater than normal and greater than the LV pressure. Instead of producing changes in the LV, MS causes the left atrium to hypertrophy and dilate. These changes predispose patients with MS to arrhythmias (which are felt as palpitations) and to the development of LA thrombi (which may lead to systemic emboli). The hypertrophied left atrium may also compress the esophagus (resulting in dysphagia) or irritate the recurrent laryngeal nerve (producing hoarseness). The increased LA pressure also causes a mid-diastolic murmur and can be reflected back into the lungs and to the right ventricle. In the lungs this produces venous congestion and hemorrhage, which cause dyspnea, fatigue, and hemoptysis."

            explanation: "Rheumatic fever (RF) is a systemic autoimmune disease that usually develops 10 days to 6 weeks after a pharyngeal infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. This autoimmune disorder results from cross-reactions between cardiac antigens and antibodies evoked by one of the many streptococcal antigens, e.g., streptococcal M protein. Rheumatic fever produces both acute and chronic manifestations. The major findings of acute RF include migratory polyarthritis of large joints, carditis, erythema marginatum of skin (although skin involvement is not very common), subcutaneous nodules, and Sydenham chorea. The acute cardiac lesions of rheumatic fever (carditis) are characterized by the accumulation of modified tissue monocytes (called Anitschkow myocytes) around areas of fibrinoid necrosis. This entire area is called an Aschoff body. The nuclei of the Anitschkow cells are long, slender, wavy ribbons that resemble a caterpillar (hence the name “caterpillar cells”). Occasional multinucleated giant cells (Aschoff cells) may be seen. The Aschoff body, which is pathognomonic for acute rheumatic fever, may be found in any of the three layers of the heart (pancarditis). In the pericardium, there is a fibrinous pericarditis, which is called a “bread and butter” pericarditis. The endocardial response in acute rheumatic fever is characterized by the formation of small friable vegetations (verrucae) along the lines of closure of the valves. In contrast, chronic RF mainly produces damage to cardiac valves. The mitral valve is most commonly involved, followed by the aortic valve. The stenotic valve has the appearance of a “fish mouth” or “buttonhole.” An additional finding in chronic RF is a rough portion of the endocardium of the left atrium, called a MacCallum’s patch."

            explanation: "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or dysplasia (ARVD) is a disorder characterized by an abnormal right ventricle that is dilated and has a thin wall that has been replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. Complications of ARVD include exercise-induced arrhythmias and sudden death. Some cases are related to mutations in the genes coding for either plakoglobin, desmoplakin (DSP), or plakophilin-2 (PKP2). Naxos syndrome (so named because it occurs only on the Greek island Naxos) is a similar disorder that is also associated with abnormalities of the gene coding for plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), an intracellular protein that links adhesion molecules in desmosomes to desmin. The clinical signs of Naxos syndrome are similar to arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, but hyperkeratoses of the plantar and palmar skin are also present. Endocardial fibrosis (EF) and Loeffler endomyocarditis (LEM) are two types of restrictive cardiomyopathies that are also associated with fibrosis of the ventricular endocardium. EF is primarily a disease of children and younger adults in tropical areas, while LEM is not restricted to these areas. In addition, LEM is often associated with an eosinophilic leukemia. It is thought that the release of major basic protein from these neoplastic eosinophils initiates the endocardial damage that leads to fibrosis."

            explanation: "Infective endocarditis is the result of microorganisms growing on any of the heart valves. These organisms may have either high virulence or low virulence. Highly virulent organisms, such as S. aureus and group A streptococci, infect previously normal valves and produce severe symptoms within 6 weeks. This abnormality is referred to as acute bacterial endocarditis. In contrast, organisms of low virulence, such as α-hemolytic viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis, infect previously damaged valves, such as valves damaged by rheumatic fever. These organisms produce symptoms that last longer than 6 weeks. This abnormality is referred to as subacute bacterial endocarditis. Infective endocarditis in IV drug abusers, which normally occurs on the tricuspid valve, is caused by S. aureus, group A streptococci, Candida species, and gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas species. Symptoms in patients with infective endocarditis are the result of bacteremia, emboli from the vegetations, immune complexes, and valvular disease. Bacteremia produces fever, positive blood cultures (several of which may be needed for confirmation), abscesses, and osteomyelitis. Embolization of parts of the large, friable vegetations can produce Roth spots in the retina, splinter hemorrhages in nail beds, and infarcts of the brain, heart, and spleen. Splenic infarcts produce left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain. Immune complexes can deposit in multiple areas of the body and cause glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, tender nodules in the fingers and toes (Osler’s nodes), and red papules in the palms and soles (Janeway lesions). Valvular disease can also result in perforation and valvular regurgitation."

            explanation: "Inflammation of the myocardium (myocarditis) has numerous causes, but most of the well-documented cases of myocarditis are of viral origin. The most common viral causes are coxsackieviruses A and B, echovirus, and influenza virus. Patients usually develop symptoms a few weeks after a viral infection. Most patients recover from the acute myocarditis, but a few may die from congestive heart failure or arrhythmias. Sections of the heart show patchy or diffuse interstitial infiltrates composed of T lymphocytes and macrophages. There may be focal or patchy acute myocardial necrosis. Bacterial infections of the myocardium produce multiple foci of inflammation composed mainly of neutrophils. Giant cell myocarditis, which was previously called Fiedler’s myocarditis, is characterized by granulomatous inflammation with giant cells and is usually rapidly fatal. In hypersensitivity myocarditis, which is caused by hypersensitivity reactions to several drugs, the inflammatory infiltrate includes many eosinophils, and the infiltrate is both interstitial and perivascular. Beriberi, one of the metabolic diseases of the heart, is a cause of high-output failure and is characterized by decreased peripheral vascular resistance and increased cardiac output.

In contrast, the vegetations of infective endocarditis are large, irregular masses that extend beyond the valves onto the chordae. Nonbacterial thrombotic (marantic) endocarditis, which is associated with prolonged debilitating diseases and cachexia, may produce one or two small, sterile vegetations at the line of valve closure. In patients with SLE, medium-sized vegetations (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) may occur on either or both sides of the valve leaflets, typically on the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve. The development of Libman-Sacks endocarditis is associated with the presence of the lupus anticoagulant (antiphospholipid syndrome), an antibody that makes platelets “sticky” and increases the chance of thrombosis."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "White plaques involving the right side of the heart are associated with the carcinoid syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by episodic flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and cyanosis. These symptoms are caused by the release of vasoactive amines, such as serotonin, from carcinoid tumors. These substances are inactivated by enzymes such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the liver, lung, and brain. MAO-A degrades norepinephrine and serotonin, while MAO-B degrades dopamine. Cardiac symptoms are found in patients with liver metastases, which bypass the inactivation by the liver itself. The cardiac lesions producing carcinoid heart disease are found on the right side of the heart because these active metabolites are inactivated in the lung. The cardiac lesions consist of fibrous plaques found on the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. Microscopic sections of these plaques reveal smooth muscle cells and sparse collagen fibers in an acid mucopolysaccharide matrix. Similar lesions can develop with the use of certain diet suppressants or with ergotamine therapy for migraine headaches. Diet suppressants associated with these lesions include dexfenfluramine (Redux) and Fen-Phen (fenfluramine and phentermine). Redux increases serotonin levels by increasing release and decreasing uptake of serotonin in the central nervous system (CNS), supposedly increasing satiety. Phentermine decreases the appetite center in the brain by increasing norepinephrine levels through increased release and decreased uptake. In contrast to carcinoid heart disease, plaques in the left atrium are seen in chronic rheumatic heart disease and are called MacCallum’s patches. Vegetations also occur in rheumatic heart disease; these are small and are found in a row along the lines of closure of the valves. Amyloid deposits may be found in the heart secondary to multiple myeloma or as an isolated event, such as in senile cardiac amyloidosis. Grossly the walls of the heart may be thickened, and there may be multiple small nodules on the left atrial endocardial surface. Iron overload can affect the heart as a result of hereditary hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis. Grossly the heart is a rust-brown color and resembles the heart in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In hypothyroidism the heart is characteristically flabby, enlarged, and dilated, which results in decreased cardiac output. This reduced circulation results in cold sensitivity. Histologically there is an interstitial mucopolysaccharide edema fluid within the heart."

            explanation: "The cardiomyopathies (CMPs) may be classified into primary and secondary forms. The primary forms are mainly idiopathic (unknown cause). Most of the secondary cardiomyopathies result in a dilated cardiomyopathy that is characterized by congestion and four-chamber dilation with hypertrophy. The walls are either of normal thickness or they may be thinner than normal. This results in a flabby, globular, banana-shaped heart that is hypocontracting. The microscopic appearance is not distinctive. The ventricles may contain mural thrombi. The causes of secondary dilated CMP are many and include alcoholism (the most common cause in the United States), metabolic disorders, and toxins. Examples of the latter include cobalt, which has been used in beer as a foam stabilizer; anthracyclines; cocaine; and iron, the deposition of which is seen in patients with hemochromatosis. The anthracycline Adriamycin, which is used in chemotherapy, causes lipid peroxidation of myofiber membranes. One final form of DCM develops in the last trimester of pregnancy or the first 6 months after delivery. About half of these patients recover full cardiac function. Other forms of cardiomyopathies include a hypertrophic form, a restrictive form, and an obliterative form. In hypertrophic CMP the major gross abnormality is within the interventricular septum, which is usually thicker than the left ventricle.

These tumors occur most often in the left atrium, and if pedunculated they may interfere with the mitral valve by a “ball valve” effect.

They are classified according to their location (membranous, infundibular, muscular) or to their size (large, medium, small). Small VSDs (<0.5 cm in diameter) are common and are usually located in the muscular septum. This type of defect, called Roger’s disease, produces a loud pansystolic murmur but causes little functional disturbance. These defects tend to close as the heart enlarges or the muscle hypertrophies. The clinical effects produced by VSDs range in severity according to the volume of blood that crosses the shunt. Patients with severe cases die secondary to left-sided congestive failure, while smaller shunts increase the risk for endocarditis. Classic signs of a VSD include dyspnea, poor growth (no cyanosis), and a pansystolic murmur over the left lower sternal border with biventricular hypertrophy. VSDs initially involve a left-to-right shunt, from the higher-pressure left side to the lower-pressure right side.

Cyanosis does not occur until later, when the shunt reverses, becoming right-to-left. This occurs because with time the pulmonary vessels become hyperplastic and irreversible pulmonary hypertension develops due to the volume overload to the lungs. The blood flow with an ASD that has reversed due to Eisenmenger’s complex is right atrium to left atrium (right-to-left) to left ventricle to aorta and then back to right atrium. An ASD with elevated pulmonary pressures allows emboli to enter the systemic circulation directly (paradoxical embolus). ASDs are the most common type of congenital heart disease that presents in adults; these individuals develop palpitations, exertional dyspnea, systolic flow murmurs, widely split fixed S2, and right axis deviation."

            question: "Prior to surgery, which of the following is the best medical therapy for a newborn infant with transposition of the pulmonary artery and aorta?",
            options: [
              "Give prostaglandin E2 to keep the ductus arteriosus open",
              "Give prostaglandin F2 to close the ductus arteriosus",

              "Give indomethacin to close the ductus arteriosus"
            ],
            correct: 0,
            explanation: "As the endocardial cushions join to divide the ventricles, the streams of blood from the right and left ventricles are divided as they flow out of the truncus. A spiral septum develops to physically separate the two streams of blood. The fusion of the spiral ridges results in division of the truncus into the pulmonary and aortic arteries. Occasionally the spiral is reversed, resulting in the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left. This is a complete transposition of the great vessels and produces two completely separate blood systems. This situation is incompatible with life unless some type of mixing of blood can occur between these separate systems. In utero, mixing of blood occurs across the atrial septum and via the placental circulation. Cases that survive to corrective surgery must have a persistent atrial septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus to allow mixing of blood. Therefore, the clinical goal is to keep the ductus arteriosus open. Normally, at birth, breathing decreases pulmonary resistance, reversing flow through the ductus arteriosus. This oxygenated blood (flowing from the aorta into the ductus) inhibits prostaglandin production, which closes the ductus arteriosus. To keep it open, prostaglandin E2 should be administered."

            explanation: "Increased intracranial pressure can result from mass lesions in the brain, cerebral edema, or hydrocephalus. It can cause swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema), headaches, vomiting, or herniation of part of the brain into the foramen magnum or under a free part of the dura. Brain herniations are classified according to the area of the brain that is herniated. Subfalcine herniations are caused by herniation of the medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere (cingulate gyrus) under the falx, which may compress the anterior cerebral artery. Transtentorial herniation, which occurs when the medial part of the temporal lobe (uncus) herniates over the free edge of the tentorium, may result in compression of the oculomotor nerve, causing pupillary dilation and ophthalmoplegia (the affected eye points “down and out”). Tentorial herniation may also compress the cerebral peduncles, within which are the pyramidal tracts. Ipsilateral compression produces contralateral motor paralysis (hemiparesis), while compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against Kernohan’s notch causes ipsilateral hemiparesis. Further caudal displacement of the entire brainstem may cause tearing of the penetrating arteries of the midbrain (Duret hemorrhages). This caudal displacement may also stretch the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve VI), causing paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle (the abnormal eye turns inward). Masses in the cerebellum may cause tonsillar herniation, in which the cerebellar tonsils are herniated into the foramen magnum. This may compress the medulla and respiratory centers, causing death. Tonsillar herniation may also occur if a lumbar puncture is performed in a patient with increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, before performing an LP, check the patient for papilledema."

The Arnold-Chiari malformation consists of herniation of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle into the foramen magnum, flattening of the base of the skull, and spina bifida with meningomyelocele. Newborns with this disorder are at risk of developing hydrocephalus within the first few days of delivery secondary to stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct. In contrast, severe hypoplasia or absence of the cerebellar vermis occurs in the Dandy-Walker malformation. There is cystic distention of the roof of the fourth ventricle, hydrocephalus, and possibly agenesis of the corpus callosum. Tuberous sclerosis may show characteristic firm, white nodules (tubers) in the cortex and subependymal nodules of gliosis protruding into the ventricles (“candle drippings”). Other signs of tuberous sclerosis include the triad of seizures, mental retardation, and congenital white spots or macules (leukoderma). Facial angiofibromata (adenoma sebaceum) may also occur. In von Hippel-Lindau disease, multiple benign and malignant neoplasms occur, including hemangioblastomas of the retina, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata; angiomas of the kidney and liver; and renal cell carcinomas. Patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a nonfamilial congenital disorder, display angiomas of the brain, leptomeninges, and ipsilateral face, which are called port-wine stains (nevus flammeus)."

These defects, which may occur anywhere along the extent of the neural tube, are classified as either caudal or cranial defects. Failure of development of the cranial end of the neural tube results in anencephaly, while failure of development of the caudal end results in spina bifida. Anencephaly, which is not compatible with life, is characterized by the absence of the forebrain, replaced by disorganized glial tissue with vessels (cerebrovasculosa). Ultrasound will reveal an abnormal head shape with absence of the skull. Neural tube defects are associated with increased maternal serum α-fetoprotein (AFP), a glycoprotein synthesized by the yolk sac and fetal liver. Increased AFP is also seen in yolk sac tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma; decreased AFP is associated with Down syndrome. Risk factors include maternal obesity and decreased folate during pregnancy. Folate supplementation reduces the incidence of these defects."

Protein-bound T4 is biologically inactive. Circulating T4 is highly bound to plasma proteins, especially to TBG, which increases during pregnancy. An increase in TBG tends to decrease free T4, which then leads to an increase in TSH secretion, causing the thyroid to increase thyroid hormone secretion. Increased secretion of thyroid hormones persists until free T4 returns to normal levels, at which time there is no longer a stimulus for increased TSH secretion. Therefore, in a chronic steady-state condition associated with elevated TBG, high plasma total T4 (bound and free) and normal plasma TSH levels would be expected. In this pregnant patient, the normal levels of total T4, along with high plasma levels of TSH, would indicate an inappropriately low plasma level of free T4. Deficient thyroid hormone secretion in this patient would be consistent with Hashimoto’s disease, the most common form of hypothyroidism."

            "explanation": "By age 45 years, only a few primordial follicles remain in the ovaries to be stimulated by gonadotropic hormones, and the production of estrogen decreases as the number of follicles approaches zero. When estrogen production falls below a critical value, it can no longer inhibit the production of gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH are produced in large quantities, but as the remaining follicles become atretic, production by the ovaries falls to zero."

As a result, there is a tendency for plasma glucose to increase, in part because decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity leads to increased hepatic glucose output. Because of the tendency for plasma glucose to increase, there is a compensatory increase in insulin secretion, including C-peptide, which is part of the insulin prohormone.

In the face of increased serum osmolarity, there should be increased ADH secretion, which should then act on the collecting duct principal cells to increase water reabsorption and concentrate the urine. The fact that the urine is dilute, not concentrated, suggests that ADH either is absent (central diabetes insipidus) or is ineffective (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Administration of an exogenous ADH analogue separates these two possibilities—it was ineffective in changing serum or urine osmolarity; thus, it can be concluded that ADH unable to act on the collecting ducts, that is, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. One cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is hypercalcemia, which is present in this patent secondary to his lung cancer; he likely has humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, due to secretion of PTH-rp by the tumor. Dehydration would cause increased ADH secretion and increased urine osmolarity.

PTH-rp has all of the actions of PTH, including increased bone resorption, increased renal Ca2+ reabsorption, and decreased renal phosphate reabsorption; all of these actions lead to increased serum Ca2+ concentration. The treatment should be directed at lowering serum Ca2+ concentration, which can be achieved by giving an inhibitor of bone resorption (e.g., pamidronate) and an inhibitor of renal Ca2+ reabsorption (furosemide). Giving an ADH antagonist would be ineffective because the man’s nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has made his collecting ducts insensitive to ADH. Giving half-normal saline could lower his serum osmolarity temporarily, but would not address the underlying problem of hypercalcemia."

Sympathetic stimulation of the airways results in a relaxation of airways, decreasing resistance. Acetylcholine is a bronchoconstrictor, increasing resistance. With low lung volumes there is a collapse of the airways, leading to decreased diameter and increased resistance."

    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "The pleural pressure (sometimes called the intrapleural pressure) is the pressure of the fluid in the narrow space between the visceral pleura of the lungs and parietal pleura of the chest wall. The pleural pressure is normally about -5 cm H₂O immediately before inspiration (i.e., at FRC) when all of the respiratory muscles are relaxed. During inspiration, the volume of the chest cavity increases and the pleural pressure becomes more negative. The pleural pressure averages about -7.5 cm H₂O immediately before expiration when the lungs are fully expanded."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Contraction of the internal intercostals and abdominal recti pull the rib cage downward during expiration. The abdominal recti and other abdominal muscles compress the abdominal contents upward toward the diaphragm, which also helps to eliminate air from the lungs. The diaphragm relaxes during expiration. The external intercostals, sternocleidomastoid muscles, and scaleni increase the diameter of the chest cavity during exercise and thus assist with inspiration, but only the diaphragm is necessary for inspiration during quiet breathing."

    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Stimulation of parasympathetic nerves results in a bronchoconstriction. With low lung volumes a collapse of the airways occurs, leading to decreased diameter and increased resistance. Histamine is a bronchoconstrictor. Forced exhalations will increase pleural pressure, decreasing airway diameter, and thus increasing resistance. All the responses are correct."

      "Increased pumping of lymphatics",
      "Increase in the concentration of interstitial proteins"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A slow increase in left heart function will lead to a gradual increase in pulmonary capillary pressure, and thus greater fluid filtration. Over time there will be an increase in lymphatics and lymphatic pumping to remove the fluid from the interstitial space. With heart failure there is an increase in fluid retention, and thus no decrease in plasma protein concentration. An increase in interstitial hydrostatic pressure will result in an increase in edema."

      "Alveolar Surface Tension: No change, Pulmonary Compliance: No change"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Surfactant is formed relatively late in fetal life. Premature babies born without adequate amounts of surfactant can develop pulmonary failure and die. Surfactant is a surface active agent that greatly reduces the surface tension of the water lining the alveoli. By reducing the surface tension of the water lining the alveoli, the surfactant reduces the work of breathing—that is, less transpulmonary pressure is required to inhale a given volume of air. Because compliance is equal to the change in lung volume for a given change in transpulmonary pressure, it should be clear that pulmonary compliance is decreased in the absence of surfactant."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Blood flow during exercise is still higher at the base of the lung compared with the apex due to gravity. During exercise there is an opening of more blood vessels in the lung, and thus better perfusion. With the opening of more blood vessels an increase in diffusing capacity occurs, allowing equilibration of the blood with O₂ in spite of the increase in flow. Due to the opening of unperfused vessels and vasodilation of existing vessels, there would be no decrease in lung blood volume. With an increase in cardiac output there will be a decrease in transit time; however, the blood is still equilibrated."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Both the lung and thoracic cage are elastic. Under normal conditions, the elastic tendency of the lungs to collapse is exactly balanced by the elastic tendency of the thoracic cage to expand. When air is introduced into the pleural space, the pleural pressure becomes equal to atmospheric pressure—the chest wall springs outward and the lungs collapse."

      "Upper Zone: Same, Middle Zone: Same, Lower Zone: Same"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The lower zones of the lung ventilate better than the upper zones, and the middle zones have intermediate ventilation. These differences in regional ventilation can be explained by regional differences in pleural pressure. The pleural pressure is typically about -10 cm H₂O in the upper regions and about -2.5 cm H₂O in the lower regions. A less negative pleural pressure in the lower regions of the chest cavity causes less expansion of the lower zones of the lung during resting conditions. Therefore, the bottom of the lung is relatively compressed during rest but expands better during inspiration compared with the apex."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Arterial content = 15 g/dl × 1.34 ml O₂/gm Hb = 20 ml O₂/dl (1 dl = 100 ml). Venous saturation is 25%, so venous content is 20 ml O₂/dl × 0.25 = 5 ml O₂/dl. Fick's principal is O₂ consumption = cardiac output (arterial content – venous content). 750 ml O₂/min = cardiac output × (20 ml O₂/dl – 5 ml O₂/dl).

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Ductus arteriosus is present in a fetus, not a healthy adult, in the segment that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta. Either this is not present in an adult or the pressures would be higher than measured because this is connected to the aorta. The foramen ovale is a cardiac shunt in the fetal heart from right atrium to left atrium, so pressures would be very low. The left atrial pressure should be between 1 and 5 mm Hg. The pulmonary artery pressure ranges from 25 systolic to ~12 to 14 mm Hg diastolic. The right atrial pressure is ~0 to 2 mm Hg."

    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Fick's law of diffusion states that Diffusion = (Pressure gradient × Surface area × Solubility)/(Distance × MW²). To simplify, make everything have a value of 1 so diffusion = 1. Now decrease surface area to 0.5 (50% decrease) and double distance to 2. Then diffusion = (1 × 0.5 × 1)/(2 × 1) = 0.25. Thus, the answer is 0.25, which is a 75% decrease from normal."

    "explanation": "It is usually not feasible to measure the left atrial pressure directly in a normal human being because it is difficult to pass a catheter through the heart chambers into the left atrium. The balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheter (Swan-Ganz catheter) was developed to estimate left atrial pressure. When the balloon is inflated on a Swan-Ganz catheter, the pressure measured through the catheter, called the wedge pressure, approximates the left atrial pressure for the following reason: blood flow distal to the catheter tip has been stopped all the way to the left atrium, which allows left atrial pressure to be estimated."

    "explanation": "A P. aeruginosa infection can increase the capillary permeability in the lungs and elsewhere in the body, which leads to excess loss of plasma proteins into the interstitial spaces. This leakage of plasma proteins from the vasculature caused the plasma colloid osmotic pressure to decrease from a normal value of about 28 mm Hg to 19 mm Hg. The capillary hydrostatic pressure remained at a normal value of 7 mm Hg, but it can sometimes increase to higher levels, exacerbating the formation of edema. The interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure has increased from a normal value of about -5 mm Hg to 1 mm Hg, which tends to decrease fluid loss from the capillaries. Excess fluid in the interstitial spaces (edema) causes lymph flow to increase."

Therefore, the humidified air has an effective total pressure of atmospheric pressure (760) – water vapor pressure (47), which yields a pressure of (760 – 47) = 713 mm Hg. The O₂ is 50% of the total gas, so the PO₂ is 713 × 0.5 = 356 mm Hg. To correct for the CO₂ in the alveoli, one then must subtract the PCO₂ divided by the respiratory quotient (normally 0.8).

The greater the pressure gradient, the faster the diffusion. The larger the cross-sectional area of the membrane, the higher will be the total number of molecules that can diffuse through the membrane. The higher the solubility of the gas, the higher will be the number of gas molecules available to diffuse for a given difference in pressure. When the distance of the diffusion pathway is shorter, it will take less time for the molecules to diffuse the entire distance.

Although the mean venous PO₂ decreases during exercise, the venous vasculature does not contain chemoreceptors that can sense PO₂. The brain, upon transmitting motor impulses to the contracting muscles, is believed to transmit collateral impulses to the brain stem to excite the respiratory center. Also, the movement of body parts during exercise is believed to excite joint and muscle proprioceptors that then transmit excitatory impulses to the respiratory center."

In the absence of surfactant, the surface tension of the small alveoli is too high. When the pressure on the small alveoli is too high (P = 2T/r), the small alveoli collapse into larger alveoli. There is decreased gas exchange with the larger, collapsed alveoli; and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, hypoxemia, and cyanosis occur.

    "explanation": "The patient’s arterial PCO₂ is lower than the normal value of 40 mm Hg because hypoxemia has stimulated peripheral chemoreceptors to increase his breathing rate; hyperventilation causes the patient to blow off extra CO₂ and results in respiratory alkalosis. In an obstructive disease, such as asthma, both forced expiratory volume (FEV₁) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are decreased, with the larger decrease occurring in FEV₁. Therefore, the FEV₁/FVC ratio is decreased. Poor ventilation of the affected areas decreases the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio and causes hypoxemia.

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Alveolar Po₂ in the left lung will equal the Po₂ in inspired air. Because there is no blood flow to the left lung, there can be no gas exchange between the alveolar air and the pulmonary capillary blood. Consequently, O₂ is not added to the capillary blood. The ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio in the left lung will be infinite (not zero or lower than that in the normal right lung) because Q (the denominator) is zero. Systemic arterial Po₂ will, of course, be decreased because the left lung has no gas exchange. Alveolar Po₂ in the right lung is unaffected."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Strenuous exercise increases the temperature and decreases the pH of skeletal muscle; both effects would cause the hemoglobin–O₂ dissociation curve to shift to the right, making it easier to unload O₂ in the tissues to meet the high demand of the exercising muscle. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (DPG) binds to the β chains of adult hemoglobin and reduces its affinity for O₂, shifting the curve to the right. In fetal hemoglobin, the β chains are replaced by γ chains, which do not bind 2,3-DPG, so the curve is shifted to the left. Because carbon monoxide (CO) increases the affinity of the remaining binding sites for O₂, the curve is shifted to the left."

At any given PO₂, the percent saturation is decreased, the P₅₀ is increased (read the PO₂ from the graph at 50% hemoglobin saturation), and unloading of O₂ in the tissues is facilitated. The O₂-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is the mL of O₂ that can be bound to a gram of hemoglobin at 100% saturation and is unaffected by the shift from curve A to curve B."

Vτ and breathing frequency are given, but dead space must be calculated. Dead space is Vτ multiplied by the difference between arterial PCO₂ and expired PCO₂ divided by arterial PCO₂. Thus, dead space = 0.45 × (41 − 35/41) = 0.066 L. Alveolar ventilation is then calculated as (0.45 L − 0.066 L) × 16 breaths/min = 6.14 L/min."

    "explanation": "Ventilation and perfusion of the lung are not distributed uniformly. Both are lowest at the apex and highest at the base. However, the differences for ventilation are not as great as for perfusion, making the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios higher at the apex and lower at the base. As a result, gas exchange is more efficient at the apex and less efficient at the base. Therefore, blood leaving the apex will have a higher PO₂ and a lower PCO₂."

This matching is accomplished without a change in mean arterial PO₂ or PCO₂. Venous PCO₂ increases because extra CO₂ is being produced by the exercising muscle.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Hypoxia is defined as decreased O₂ delivery to the tissues. It occurs as a result of decreased blood flow or decreased O₂ content of the blood. Decreased O₂ content of the blood is caused by decreased hemoglobin concentration (anemia), decreased O₂-binding capacity of hemoglobin (carbon monoxide poisoning), or decreased arterial PO₂ (hypoxemia). Hypoventilation, right-to-left cardiac shunt, and ascent to high altitude all cause hypoxia by decreasing arterial PO₂. Of these, only right-to-left cardiac shunt is associated with an increased A–a gradient, reflecting a lack of O₂ equilibration between alveolar gas and systemic arterial blood. In right-to-left shunt, a portion of the right heart output, or pulmonary blood flow, is not oxygenated in the lungs and thereby 'dilutes' the PO₂ of the normally oxygenated blood. With hypoventilation and ascent to high altitude, both alveolar and arterial PO₂ are decreased, but the A–a gradient is normal."

As a result, arterial PO₂ is decreased (<100 mm Hg), and hypoxemia occurs and causes hyperventilation by an effect on peripheral chemoreceptors. Hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (DPG) levels increase adaptively; 2,3-DPG binds to hemoglobin and causes the hemoglobin–O₂ dissociation curve to shift to the right to improve unloading of O₂ in the tissues.

Thus, breathing high PO₂ air will raise the PO₂ of a large volume of blood and have the greatest influence on the total blood flow leaving the lungs (which becomes systemic arterial blood). Dead space (i.e., V/Q = ∞) has no blood flow, so supplemental O₂ has no effect on these regions. Shunt (i.e., V/Q = 0) has no ventilation, so supplemental O₂ has no effect.

In pulmonary fibrosis, there is thickening of the alveolar/pulmonary capillary barrier and increased diffusion distance for O₂, which results in lack of equilibration of O₂, hypoxemia, and increased A–a gradient. Hypoventilation and ascent to 12,000 feet also cause hypoxemia, because systemic arterial blood is equilibrated with a lower alveolar PO₂ (normal A–a gradient).

Also, because she is hypoxemic, she does not have carbon monoxide poisoning (which would decrease O₂ content of blood but would not decrease PaO₂). Right-to-left shunt as the cause of the woman’s hypoxemia is further supported by calculating the A–a gradient as follows.

      "Inhibits ovulation",
      "Increased in females after menopause",
      "Not needed for spermatogenesis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "LH (luteinizing hormone) is increased in females after menopause due to the loss of negative feedback from ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone). After menopause, the ovaries stop producing these hormones, leading to elevated levels of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) as the pituitary is no longer inhibited. LH is a glycoprotein (not a simple protein), is present in males where it stimulates testosterone production, triggers ovulation (rather than inhibiting it), and is essential for spermatogenesis by stimulating testosterone production in Leydig cells."

Patients have female genitalia (not male), short stature (not tall), and typically normal intelligence (no mental retardation). Gynecomastia is characteristic of Klinefelter syndrome, not Turner syndrome."

    "options": [
      "Prostate",
      "Seminal vesicles",
      "Cowper's glands",
      "Epididymis", 
      "Ejaculatory ducts"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The seminal vesicles provide about 70% of the seminal fluid volume. Their secretion contains proteins, enzymes, fructose, mucus, and prostaglandins. The prostate contributes 10-30%, Cowper's glands produce pre-ejaculate fluid, the epididymis stores and matures sperm but doesn't contribute significantly to fluid volume, and the ejaculatory ducts are passageways rather than secretory glands."

      "LH",
      "FSH", 
      "Estrogen",
      "Progesterone",
      "hCG"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Progesterone rises significantly following ovulation as the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes large amounts of progesterone (along with some estrogen). LH and FSH decline after ovulation due to negative feedback from progesterone and estrogen. Estrogen has two peaks - one just before ovulation and another during the mid-luteal phase. hCG is only produced during pregnancy."

      "Degenerates during the second trimester",
      "Responds to both FSH and LH"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The corpus luteum is essential for maintaining pregnancy during the first 6-8 weeks by producing progesterone and estrogen until the placenta takes over hormone production. It is maintained by hCG from the placenta (not controlled by it), doesn't degenerate until after delivery, responds primarily to LH (not FSH), and the corpus albicans is the degenerated form after luteal regression."

      "Cutaneous cells, Sertoli cells and neural cells in the hypothalamus"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Normal spermatogenesis requires: Sertoli cells (for physical support, blood-testes barrier, and nutrient provision), Leydig cells (for testosterone production), and basophils of the pituitary (which secrete FSH and LH). Germ cells alone are insufficient without the supporting cells and hormonal regulation."

      "Degenerates as soon as the fertilized ovum is implanted",
      "Requires human chorionic gonadotrophin"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "The corpus luteum of pregnancy requires human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for its maintenance beyond the normal luteal phase. hCG acts as a luteotropic and luteinizing hormone, preventing degeneration of the corpus luteum and ensuring continued production of progesterone and estrogen during early pregnancy until the placenta takes over hormone production."

      "A temperature equal to body temperature",
      "Low potassium in seminal fluid",
      "120 days for development of sperms"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Normal spermatogenesis requires both FSH (which acts on Sertoli cells to produce androgen-binding protein) and testosterone (which is essential for the conversion of spermatids to spermatozoa). Spermatogenesis occurs at temperatures lower than body temperature (about 32°C), takes approximately 74 days (not 120), and the potassium concentration in seminal fluid is not a determining factor."

      "LH peak during mid-cycle",
      "Ductular growth in the breast"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Progesterone makes the cervical mucus thick, scanty, and difficult to penetrate by sperm. The proliferative phase is caused by estrogen (not progesterone), ovulation is triggered by the LH surge (not progesterone), the LH peak occurs before significant progesterone production, and ductular growth in the breast is primarily estrogen-mediated."

    "question": "Ovulation:",
    "options": [
      "Normally occurs 14 days following uterine bleeding",
      "Immediately occurs following LH surge",
      "Is usually associated with a central abdominal pain", 
      "Is due to rupture of the corpus luteum",
      "Leads to a rise in the body temperature"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Ovulation leads to a rise in body temperature due to the thermogenic effect of progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum. Ovulation occurs 14 days BEFORE the next menstrual period (not after bleeding), occurs about 9 hours after the LH peak (not immediately), is associated with lower abdominal pain (not central), and results from rupture of the mature follicle (not the corpus luteum)."

      "Estradiol",
      "hCG",
      "LH"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Pregnancy tests detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast of the developing placenta. hCG appears in blood about 6 days after implantation and in urine about 14 days after implantation. The other hormones are not specific to pregnancy and cannot reliably indicate pregnancy."

      "Sperm production is cyclic",
      "Continuous release of GnRH is essential for spermatogenesis", 
      "Sertoli cells are needed for mitotic and meiotic activity of germ cells",
      "FSH acts on Leydig cells to stimulate release of testosterone",
      "LH acts on Sertoli cells to stimulate release androgen binding protein"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Sertoli cells provide physical support and nutrients essential for both mitotic and meiotic divisions of germ cells during spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is continuous (not cyclic) in males, GnRH release is pulsatile (not continuous), FSH acts on Sertoli cells (not Leydig cells), and LH acts on Leydig cells (not Sertoli cells) to stimulate testosterone production."

    "question": "During 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, the primary source of estrogen and progesterone is the:",
    "options": [
      "Corpus luteum",

      "Placenta",
      "Adrenal cortex",
      "Pituitary gland"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "After the first 6-8 weeks of pregnancy, the placenta becomes the primary source of estrogen and progesterone. The corpus luteum degenerates around this time, the ovarian follicles are inactive during pregnancy, and while the adrenal cortex produces some androgens that can be converted to estrogen, it is not the primary source."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following statements about estrogen is not true:",
    "options": [
      "Interacts with intracellular protein receptors",
      "Increases synthesis of thyroid binding protein", 
      "Decreases uterine contractions",
      "Decreases FSH secretion",
      "Is released from the testes"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Estrogen actually increases uterine contractions by making the uterus more excitable to oxytocin, not decreasing them. All other statements are true: estrogen interacts with intracellular receptors, increases hepatic production of thyroid-binding globulin, exerts negative feedback on FSH secretion (except at mid-cycle), and small amounts are produced in the testes via aromatase conversion of androgens."

  {
    "question": "Testosterone is not:",
    "options": [
      "Produced during intra-uterine life",
      "An anabolic hormone", 
      "Mostly protein bound",
      "Inhibited directly by inhibin",
      "Inhibitory to LH"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Testosterone is NOT directly inhibited by inhibin. Inhibin specifically inhibits FSH secretion, not testosterone. Testosterone is produced during intrauterine life, has anabolic effects (promotes protein synthesis), is 98% protein-bound in plasma, and exerts negative feedback inhibition on LH secretion."

  {
    "question": "In a normal menstrual cycle:",
    "options": [
      "High estrogen maintains the corpus luteum",
      "Progesterone is highest during early days of menstrual cycle", 
      "LH peak is preceded by estrogen peak",
      "Ovulation depends on FSH surge",
      "The life span of corpus luteum determines duration of the cycle"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The LH peak at mid-cycle is preceded by a peak in estrogen levels. Just before ovulation, rising estrogen switches from negative to positive feedback on the pituitary, triggering the LH surge. The corpus luteum is maintained by LH (not estrogen), progesterone is lowest during early menstrual days, ovulation depends on LH surge (not FSH), and the follicular phase variability determines cycle length (the luteal phase is relatively constant at 14 days)."

    "question": "Which of the followings is NOT secreted by Sertoli cells:",
    "options": [
      "Androgen binding protein",
      "Testosterone", 
      "Mullerian inhibitory substance",
      "Inhibin",
      "Estrogens"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Testosterone is secreted by Leydig cells (interstitial cells), not Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells do secrete androgen binding protein (in response to FSH), Mullerian inhibitory substance (during fetal development), inhibin (which inhibits FSH), and estrogens (via aromatase conversion of androgens)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Concerning spermatogenesis:",
    "options": [
      "Testosterone is not essential",
      "The secondary spermatocyte contains 23 chromosomes", 
      "FSH has no role",
      "The process takes 74 hours",
      "Involves division of Sertoli cells to form sperms"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The secondary spermatocyte contains 23 chromosomes (haploid) after the first meiotic division. Testosterone is essential for the final maturation of spermatids to spermatozoa, FSH is crucial for stimulating Sertoli cells, spermatogenesis takes 74 days (not hours), and Sertoli cells support but do not divide to form sperm - germ cells undergo the divisions."

    "question": "Progesterone:",
    "options": [
      "Acts on cell membrane receptors",
      "Stimulates the respiratory centre to increase respiration", 
      "Acts directly on the hypothalamus to activate the temperature centre",
      "Promotes proliferative changes in the endometrium",
      "Stimulates development of ducts in the breast"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Progesterone stimulates the respiratory center, causing hyperventilation during pregnancy and the luteal phase. Progesterone acts on intracellular receptors (not cell membrane), its thermogenic effect is metabolic (not via hypothalamic temperature center), estrogen (not progesterone) causes proliferative changes, and progesterone stimulates lobular and alveolar breast development (not ductular, which is estrogen-mediated)."

      "Is secreted by the granulosa cells",
      "Is detected by pregnancy test to diagnose pregnancy"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "hCS causes lipolysis, providing free fatty acids as an alternative energy source for the mother. hCS is a protein hormone (not steroid), reduces glucose utilization by the MOTHER (not fetus) to spare glucose for fetal use, is secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts (not granulosa cells), and pregnancy tests detect hCG (not hCS)."

      "Increased cardiac output",
      "Increased lung volumes and capacities",
      "Decreased erythropoiesis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Pregnancy does NOT increase lung volumes and capacities; in fact, the upward displacement of the diaphragm by the enlarged uterus actually REDUCES lung volumes. All other options are correct maternal adaptations: GFR increases by 50-60%, plasma volume increases by 40-50%, cardiac output increases by 30-50%, and while red blood cell mass increases, the relative hemodilution can give the appearance of decreased erythropoiesis."

Physical examination revealed a tall female with a short, blind-ended vagina and no palpable cervix. Ultrasound showed the absence of a uterus and no ovaries and the presence of undescended testes. Deficiency of which enzyme, hormone, or receptor is most likely to account for these findings?",
    "options": [

      "Progesterone",
      "5a-Reductase"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This describes complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (testicular feminization). The patient has a 46,XY karyotype with testes that produce testosterone and MIS normally. However, due to androgen receptor deficiency, the body cannot respond to androgens, leading to female external genitalia development. MIS from Sertoli cells causes regression of Müllerian structures (uterus, fallopian tubes), resulting in a blind vaginal pouch. The testes remain undescended, and patients are tall due to delayed epiphyseal closure from lack of androgen effects."

    "question": "A blood sample is taken from a 27-year-old woman for hormone analysis. The sample contains low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and high levels of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin. Assuming a normal 28-day menstrual cycle, on which day of this woman's menstrual cycle was the blood sample taken?",

      "Day 21",
      "Day 28"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Day 21 corresponds to the mid-luteal phase when the corpus luteum is fully functional, secreting high levels of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin. These hormones exert strong negative feedback on the pituitary, suppressing FSH and LH secretion. This hormonal profile is characteristic of the luteal phase and essential for preparing the endometrium for potential implantation."

    "question": "A 37-year-old woman who is breast-feeding her 4-month-old son is taking the train to see her mother who lives several hours away. When the woman hears the cry of another infant, she notices that milk has been expressed from both her breasts. The release of which hormone can account for this response?",
    "options": [

      "Oxytocin",
      "Progesterone",
      "Prolactin"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Oxytocin is responsible for milk ejection (let-down reflex) by causing contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding breast alveoli. This reflex can be conditioned by various stimuli including infant crying, thinking about the baby, or emotional states. Prolactin is responsible for milk production (lactogenesis), not milk ejection."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Oxytocin levels peak during the expulsive stage of labor when the fetus descends and cervical dilation is maximal. This creates a positive feedback loop: cervical stretching stimulates oxytocin release, which causes stronger uterine contractions, leading to more cervical stretching. This Ferguson reflex ensures progressive labor until delivery."

    "explanation": "The syncytiotrophoblast is the outermost layer of chorionic villi, directly bathed in maternal blood in the intervillous space. Glucose from maternal blood must first cross this continuous, multinucleated cell layer before passing through the cytotrophoblast, basement membrane, and fetal capillary endothelium to reach fetal circulation."

      "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone",
      "Inhibin",
      "Progesterone"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Sustained high levels of estrogen from the developing dominant follicle switch from negative to positive feedback on the pituitary around mid-cycle. This positive feedback sensitizes gonadotropes to GnRH, triggering the LH surge that induces ovulation. This is a unique neuroendocrine phenomenon specific to the menstrual cycle."

    "explanation": "The temperature of the testes must be considerably below that of the internal body temperature for spermatogenesis to occur. The testes are normally maintained at a temperature of about 32°C, and are kept cool by a countercurrent heat exchange between the spermatic arteries and veins and by air circulating around the scrotum. The testes develop in the abdomen but normally descend into the scrotum during fetal development. In ~10% of newborn males, one or, less commonly, both testes remain in the abdominal cavity or inguinal canal. Although most (98%) of undescended testes (cryptorchidism) spontaneously descend by 1 year, and all but 0.3% spontaneously descend by puberty, early surgical treatment is recommended because abdominal temperatures can cause irreversible damage to the spermatogenic epithelium and the incidence of malignant tumors is higher in undesecnded than in scrotal testes. Maturation of spermatogonia, the primitive germ cells, into primary spermatocytes does not begin until adolescence. Throughout the reproductive life of the human male, 100 to 200 million sperm are produced daily. Of critical importance to the hormonal regulation of spermatogenesis are the pulsatile release of GRH and the subsequent involvement of FSH and LH at their target cells. FSH acts directly on the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules to initiate mitotic and meiotic activity of germ cells. LH effects are thought to be mediated via stimulation of testosterone secretion by the Leydig cells."

Normal adult serum levels of prolactin are about the same or only slightly higher in females compared to males. Consistent with its role in lactogenesis, prolactin secretion increases during pregnancy. Suckling increases prolactin secretion, but milk ejection during suckling is due to oxytocin release. Prolactin inhibits reproductive function by inhibiting hypothalamic GnRH release and pituitary gonadotropin secretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both males and females. Pregnancy and lactation are the most important physiological causes of hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, hypothyroidism, and drug-induced inhibition or disruption of dopaminergic receptor function are other common causes of hyperprolactinemia."

Estrogen levels also increase, but do not reach the levels achieved during the follicular phase. In anorexia nervosa, the regulation of virtually every endocrine system is altered, but the most striking changes occur in the reproductive system. Amenorrhea in anorexia nervosa is hypothalamic in origin and reflects decreased production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (with low levels of LH and FSH) that may be due to a marked reduction in leptin associated with the decreased mass of adipose tissue.

They are attached to each other by specialized junctional complexes that limit the movement of fluid and solute molecules from the interstitial space and blood to the tubular lumen, and thus form a blood-testis barrier that provides an immunologically privileged environment for sperm maturation. Sertoli cells are intimately associated with developing spermatozoa and play a major role in germ-cell maturation.

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Implantation of a zygote into the uterine wall involves infiltration of the endometrium by the syncytiotrophoblast. Fertilization and early cleavage of the zygote occur in the fallopian tube in the human female. After approximately 3 days, the zygote enters the uterine cavity, where it undergoes additional divisions over a period of 3 to 4 days to form a morula of approximately 60 cells that is transformed into a blastocyst consisting of the yolk sac and embryo. Enzymatic digestion of the zona pellucida and infiltration of the endometrium by the syncytiotrophoblast, which forms the outer layer of the blastocyst, result in implantation of the blastocyst within the endometrium, where it erodes into maternal vessels. During these early stages of embryogenesis, the endometrium is primed by progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum in the ovary in response to pituitary gonadotropin secretion. After 10 to 15 days, placental gonadotropins maintain the corpus luteum until placental synthesis of progesterone is established at 6 to 8 weeks of gestation. Large dose estrogens, diethystilbesterol, and mifepristone (RU486) are examples of postcoital contraceptives."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Preparation of primordial ovarian follicles for ovulation is the primary function of FSH. FSH stimulates development of the theca and granulose cells of the follicles and promotes the synthesis of estrogens, including estradiol. LH promotes luteinization of the postovulatory follicle and stimulates progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum.

    "explanation": "Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum. The plasma level of progesterone is low during the menses and remains low until just prior to ovulation. It rises substantially after ovulation, owing to secretion by the corpus luteum. If fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone until the placenta develops and begins to produce large amounts of the hormone. The plasma level of progesterone rises steadily throughout pregnancy after the placenta takes over production at about 12 weeks of gestation."

    "explanation": "Estrogens cause the mucus secreted by the cervix to become thinner and more alkaline and to exhibit a fernlike pattern upon drying. The epithelium of the vagina is so sensitive to estrogen action that vaginal smear examination is used for a bioassay of the hormone. Estrogens can stimulate growth of ovarian follicles even in hypophysectomized women and also stimulate growth of the glandular epithelium of the endometrium, the smooth muscle of the uterus, and the uterine vascular system. Growth of the glandular elements of the breast is stimulated by progesterone; growth of the ductal elements is stimulated by estrogen."

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The testosterone metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induces the formation of the male external genitalia and male secondary sex characteristics. The fetus develops with bipotential internal and external genitalia that can develop (at about 40 days gestation) into either a testis or ovary, depending upon which genes are expressed. When the embryo has functional testes, male internal and external genitalia develop. The Leydig cells of the fetal testis secrete testosterone and the Sertoli cells secrete milleframinhibiting substance (MIS), also known as antimüllerian hormone (AMH), a member of the TGF-β growth factor family. The development of male internal genitalia depends upon testosterone, which stimulates growth and development of the Wolfflam ducts and MIS, which stimulates Müllerian duct regression. Individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome have an XXY chromosomal pattern, which is the most common sex chromosome disorder. These individuals have internal and external male genitalia, and testosterone secretion at puberty is often great enough for the development of male characteristics. However, the testes are small and the seminiferous tubules are abnormal, leading to infertility, ennuchoid proportions, gynecomastia, and poor virilization in phenotypic males. Mental retardation, developmental delay, or learning disabilities may be present. Patients with mosaic forms of Klinefelter's syndrome have less severe clinical features, larger testes, and may achieve fertility."

      "Estradiol",
      "Insulin",

    "explanation": "Prolactin causes milk secretion from the breast after estrogen and progesterone priming. Its effect on the breast involves increased action of mRNA and increased production of casein and lactalbumin, but the hormone action is not exerted on the cell nucleus. The actions of progesterone are prevented by inhibitors of microtubules. Oxytocin is a posterior pituitary peptide that promotes contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding breast ducts and causes expulsion of milk from lobular alveoli. Secretion of oxytocin is promoted by tactile stimulation of the breast by the nursing infant. It can also be elicited by psychic factors alone, such as the anticipation of nursing brought on by hearing the cry of the hungry infant. This anticipatory secretion of oxytocin may be experienced by the mother as a sensation of milk letdown in which milk appears at the nipple and may be forcibly ejected."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Because of the challenge of weighing the benefits versus risks for each individual, whether or not to use postmenopausal hormone therapy is one of the most complex health-care decisions facing women. In both observational studies and randomized trials, hormone therapy (either estrogen alone or estrogen/progestin) shows definite improvement in vasomotor symptoms (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and vaginal dryness, and in increasing bone density and reducing the risk of fractures. However, observational studies promoting the use of hormone therapy as a strategy to delay the postmenopausal onset of cardiovascular disease have recently been refuted by randomized trials showing an increased risk of coronary artery disease in stroke with hormone replacement therapy. Hormone therapy also increases the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer (with long-term use), venous thromboembolism, and gallbladder disease.

      "In the population, sperm counts in semen have increased over the last 20 years"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Semen contains chemicals that prevent sperm capacitation, thereby prolonging the viability of the sperm. In addition, the high potassium content of the secretion inhibits sperm motility, further adding to the viability. Semen is secreted primarily by the seminiferous tubules and the alkaline nature of the secretion buffers the acidity of the vagina.

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "In non-pregnant women, the secretion of prolactin is kept tonically suppressed by secretion of dopamine from the hypothalamus. Prolactin is the main hormone of lactation. Hormone levels increase early in pregnancy due to the influence of estrogens. However, lactation does not occur early in pregnancy because estrogens and progesterone inhibit the interaction of prolactin with receptors located on the alveolar cell membranes.

    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "During pregnancy, the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary axis is suppressed due to high circulating levels of sex hormones. This leads to reduced gonadotropin levels, and, thus, ovulation does not occur. Additionally, hyperventilation leads to decreased arterial carbon dioxide levels. Increased water retention leads to decreased hematocrit. Maternal use of glucose declines and, as a result, glu-concogenesis increases. Plasma cortisol levels increase as the result of progesterone-mediated displacement from transcortin and its subsequent binding to globulin."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "**Adjuvants** (like aluminum salts) enhance the immune response to an antigen. They often work by creating a depot effect (slow release) or by stimulating **innate immune receptors** (TLRs) to increase costimulator expression on APCs, thus promoting T cell activation."

      "Present lipids."
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "**Cross-presentation** is critical for antiviral immunity. It allows uninfected DCs to ingest viral remnants from dead cells and shunt these exogenous antigens into the **MHC Class I** pathway (normally for endogenous proteins). This permits the priming of **CD8+ T cells** even if the DC itself is not infected."

      "The release of viral RNA.",
      "Apoptosis."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "By blocking **TAP** (Transporter associated with Antigen Processing), the virus prevents its peptides from entering the ER. Consequently, **MHC Class I** molecules are not loaded with viral antigens and fail to reach the surface, rendering the cell invisible to **CD8+ CTLs**."
  },
  {
    "question": "The 'Original Antigenic Sin' theory suggests that upon reinfection with a variant strain of a virus, the immune system:",
    "options": [

      "Produces only IgM.",
      "Activates only innate immunity."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "**Original Antigenic Sin** (or Imprinting) describes the tendency of the immune system to rely on **memory** from the **first encounter**. It boosts antibodies against conserved epitopes rather than making new ones against the unique epitopes of the new variant, potentially resulting in a suboptimal response."

      "The virus integrates into germ cells.",
      "The virus inhibits all cytokines."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "**Latency** allows the virus (e.g., HSV in neurons, EBV in B cells) to go dormant. By shutting down the expression of most viral proteins, it presents no antigens for CTLs to detect, allowing it to **persist** for the life of the host."
