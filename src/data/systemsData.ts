            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Lipids are transported in the blood complexed to proteins called apo-lipoproteins. Abnormalities of this lipid transport or metabolism result in hyperlipoproteinemias, which are responsible for most syndromes of premature atherosclerosis. The primary hyperlipidemias are divided into five distinct electrophoretic patterns. Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, caused by a mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene, results in increased chylomicrons and triglycerides. Type II hyperlipoproteinemia, perhaps the most frequent Mendelian disorder, is caused by a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. This results in increased LDL and cholesterol. Homozygotes for this gene defect have markedly increased plasma cholesterol levels and develop severe atherosclerosis at an early age. Xanthomas of the Achilles tendon are somewhat specific for this disorder. Mutations in the apolipoprotein E gene result in type III hyperlipoproteinemia, which is characterized by increased intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), triglycerides, and cholesterol. Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia causes increased very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and triglycerides. The genetic defect causing this abnormality is a mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene. Type V hyperlipoproteinemia, caused by a mutation in apolipoprotein CII, results in increased VLDLs, chylomicrons, triglycerides, and cholesterol."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Increased serum lipids (hyperlipidemia) may be a primary genetic defect or may be secondary to another disorder, such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, the nephrotic syndrome, or hypothyroidism. Secondary hypertriglyceridemia in patients with diabetes mellitus usually occurs secondary to increased blood levels of VLDL. The reason for this is that with decreased levels of insulin with diabetes mellitus there is increased mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (increased lipolysis). This increases delivery of free fatty acids to the liver, which increases production and secretion of VLDL by the liver. This is a type IV hyperlipidemia pattern. Ethanol can also produce a type IV pattern due to increased VLDL. This is because ethanol also increases lipolysis of adipose tissue, which increases delivery of free fatty acids to the liver. Ethanol also increases the esterification of fatty acid to triglycerides in the liver and inhibits the release of lipoproteins from the liver."

            explanation: "There are various risk factors that predispose individuals to the development of atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. These risk factors are either quite significant (major factors) or less significant (minor factors). Major factors include diet and hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia), hypertension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Minor risk factors include obesity, lack of physical exercise, male gender, stress, oral contraceptives (birth control pills), and hyperhomocystinemia. Another minor risk factor is the presence in the serum of lipoprotein(a), which is an altered form of LDL, that contains the apoprotein B100 linked to apoprotein(a). This special type of apoprotein has structural homology to plasminogen. These similar areas are called kringles because they resemble a type of Danish pastry. It is thought that, because of the similarity of structure, Lp(a) competes with plasminogen in clots and decreases the ability to form plasmin and clear clots."

            explanation: "The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis depends in part on the inflammatory function of macrophages, which involves the release of numerous cytokines. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is mitogenic and chemotactic for smooth-muscle cells. This may explain the recruitment and proliferation of smooth-muscle cells in atherosclerosis. Other macrophage products participate in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis by other means. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transform the normally anticoagulant endothelial surface into a procoagulant surface by stimulating endothelial cells to produce platelet-activating factor (PAF), tissue factor (TF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). Interferon alpha and transforming growth factor beta inhibit cell proliferation. This could explain the failure of endothelial cells to repair endothelial defects. These defects could then either provide entry areas for lipoproteins and plasma-derived factors or serve as an area where thrombi are formed."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "Hypertension is associated with two forms of damage to small blood vessels: hyaline arteriolosclerosis and hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis, which is also a vascular complication of patients with diabetes mellitus, is presumably caused by leakage of plasma components across the endothelium. Microscopic examination will reveal the lumens of small arterioles to be narrowed by homogenous pink (hyaline) deposits in the walls. These changes within the kidney are referred to as benign nephrosclerosis, in which the decreased blood supply causes loss of nephrons and a characteristic finely granular appearance to the kidney surface. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is associated with benign hypertension. In contrast, hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis is associated with malignant hypertension, which refers to dramatic elevations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure often resulting in early death from cerebral and brainstem hemorrhages. Pathologically, the renal vessels demonstrate a concentric obliteration of arterioles by an increase in smooth-muscle cells and protein deposition in a laminar configuration (onionskining) that includes fibrin material, which leads to total and subtotal occlusion of the vessels. These changes are called hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. Medial calcific sclerosis (Mnckeberg’s arteriosclerosis) is characterized by dystrophic calcification in the tunica media of muscular arteries. There is no narrowing of the lumen of the affected vessels. Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s disease) is occlusion by a proliferative inflammatory process in arteries of heavy cigarette smokers and is often associated with HLA-A9,B5 genotypes. Finally, the term “arteriosclerosis obliterans” refers to arteriosclerosis of the extremities (peripheral vascular disease)."

Immunofluorescence reveals ANCAs to have two different patterns. One is directed toward myeloperoxidase of neutrophils and is found in a perinuclear location (P-ANCAs). This pattern is seen in patients with microscopic PAN or idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis without systemic disease. Microscopic PAN commonly involves glomerular and pulmonary capillaries and may produce hematuria, hemoptysis, and renal failure. Histologic sections reveal segmental fibrinoid necrosis. The other ANCA pattern reveals the antibodies to be directed against neutral leukocyte protease (proteinase 3) and results in a cytoplasmic staining pattern (C-ANCAs).

The differential diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis includes microscopic PAN and three other disorders: Henoch-Schnlein purpura, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Henoch-Schnlein purpura is a disorder of children who present with hemorrhagic urticaria and hematuria following an upper respiratory infection. The pathology of this disease involves the deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in small vessels of the skin. Because the antibody is IgA, the alternate complement pathway is activated in these patients. Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) is characterized by acute necrotizing granulomas of the upper and lower respiratory tract, focal necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels, and renal disease. Histologically there is fibrinoid necrosis of small arteries, early infiltration by neutrophils, and granuloma formation with giant cells. The peak incidence is in the fifth decade, and many patients have C-ANCAs. The disease is highly fatal, with death occurring within 1 year, unless recognized and treated with immunosuppressive agents. Churg-Strauss syndrome (allergic vasculitis) is a form of necrotizing vasculitis with granulomas of the respiratory tract and asthma.

It used to be found exclusively in men, but recently there has been an increase in the number of reported cases in women. The vessels primarily affected are in the extremities, and this leads to painful ischemia and gangrene of the legs and arms due to thrombosis. Histologic sections reveal an acute inflammatory infiltrate involving the entire wall of the vessel. In contrast to atherosclerosis, small microabscesses may be seen within thrombi. The inflammation leads to intimal proliferation that obliterates the lumen and causes pain. The disease may regress on cessation of smoking. In contrast, granulomatous inflammation with giant cells involving blood vessels can be seen with temporal arteritis or Takayasu’s arteritis.

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "An aneurysm is an abnormal dilation of any vessel. The causes of aneurysms are many, but the two most important ones are atherosclerosis and cystic medial necrosis. Atherosclerotic aneurysms, the most common type of aortic aneurysms, usually occur distal to the renal arteries and proximal to the bifurcation of the aorta. Many atherosclerotic aneurysms are asymptomatic, but if they rupture they produce sudden, severe abdominal pain, shock, and a risk of death. Prior to rupture, physical examination reveals a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. Cystic medial necrosis refers to the focal loss of elastic and muscle fibers in the media of vessels and is seen in patients with hypertension, dissecting aneurysms, and Marfan’s syndrome. Trauma may also lead to the formation of dissecting aneurysms. Berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of arteries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms are caused by obliterative endarteritis of the vasa vasorum of the aorta. These aneurysms are part of the tertiary manifestation of syphilis and become evident 15 to 20 years after persons have contracted the initial infection with Treponema pallidum. Elastic tissue and smooth-muscle cells of the media undergo ischemic destruction as a result of the treponemal infection (obliterative endarteritis). As a consequence of ischemia in the media, musculoelastic support is lost and fibrosis occurs. Grossly, the aorta has a “tree-bark” appearance. Luetic aneurysms almost always occur in the thoracic aorta and may lead to luetic heart disease by producing insufficiency of the aortic valve (aortic regurgitation)."

            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Dissecting aneurysms are usually the result of cystic medial necrosis of the aorta. This abnormality results from loss of elastic tissue in the media and is associated with hypertension and Marfan’s syndrome. Most cases of dissecting aneurysms involve a transverse tear in the intima and are located in the ascending aorta, just above the aortic ring. The pain caused by a dissecting aneurysm is similar to the pain caused by a myocardial infarction, but it extends into the abdomen as the dissection progresses. Additionally, the blood pressure is not decreased with a dissecting aneurysm unless the aorta itself has ruptured. In contrast, berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of arteries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Rupture of these aneurysms may produce a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Berry aneurysms have been noted in about one-sixth of patients with adult polycystic renal disease and account for death in about 10% of patients with this type of polycystic renal disease. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms occur in the thoracic aorta and may lead to luetic heart disease by producing insufficiency of the aortic valve. Mycotic (infectious) aneurysms result from microbial infection during septicemia, usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis. They are prone to rupture and hemorrhage. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of eight syndromes characterized by defects in collagen synthesis. In EDS IV there is deficient synthesis of type III collagen and a tendency to rupture of muscular arteries, including dissecting aneurysms of the aorta."

            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Benign tumors of vessels may originate from either blood vessels or lymphatics. Lymphangiomas are tumors that are derived from lymphatic vessels. Histologically they reveal dilated vessels lined by endothelial cells, but they lack red blood cells in their lumen. The absence of red blood cells helps to distinguish these lesions from hemangiomas. Cystic hygromas are cystic lymphangiomas that typically occur in the neck or axilla. They may grow to such a large size that the neck is deformed. These lesions may be found in patients with Turner’s syndrome, an abnormality that results from complete or partial monosomy for the X chromosome. Swelling of the neck in these individuals occurs because of dilated lymphatic vessels. With time the swelling decreases, but patients may develop bilateral neck webbing and loose skin on the back of the neck. In contrast, dilated blood vessels (vascular ectasia) may be congenital or acquired. “Birthmarks” may be caused by congenital vascular ectasia (nevus flammeus) or capillary hemangiomas. “Port-wine stains” are similar lesions that may be caused by vascular ectasia or cavernous hemangiomas of the skin. Spider angiomas are acquired vascular ectasias that are the result of increased estrogen levels. They are associated with pregnancy and liver disease. Bacillary angiomatosis is a nonneoplastic proliferation of blood vessels that is found in immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with AIDS. Histologically, there are proliferating capillaries that are lined by protuberant endothelial cells. Additionally, numerous neutrophils are present along with nuclear dust and purple granules. These latter granules are Rickettsia-like bacteria that are the cause of this lesion, which responds to erythromycin."

Hemangiomas may be subclassified as capillary or cavernous. The juvenile (strawberry) hemangioma is a fast-growing lesion that appears in the first few months of life, but most completely regresses by the age of 5 years. Unless near the eye, definitive therapy is usually not indicated, as the possible techniques, such as surgery, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and injection of sclerosing drugs, all cause more scarring than is produced by spontaneous resolution."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) comprises four distinct forms. The classic, or European, form has been known since 1862. It occurs in older men of Eastern European or Mediterranean origin (predominantly Italian or Jewish) and is characterized by purple maculopapular skin lesions of the lower extremities and visceral involvement in only 10% of cases. The African form occurs in younger people and is more aggressive; it often involves lymph nodes in children. The rare form in immunosuppressed recipients of renal transplants often regresses when immunosuppression stops. In the epidemic form associated with AIDS, skin lesions may occur anywhere and disseminate to the mucous membranes, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lymph nodes, and viscera. Histologic determination is difficult, but all four clinical types appear similar. In the early stages, irregular, dilated epidermal vascular spaces, extravasated red cells, and hemosiderin are characteristic. This histologic appearance is very similar to that of granulation tissue or stasis dermatitis. Later in the disease process, more characteristic lesions show spindle cells around slit spaces with extravasation of erythrocytes. In contrast, irregular vascular spaces lined by nests of uniform cells describe the histologic appearance of a glomus tumor, while multiple dilated endothelial-lined vessels that lack red blood cells describe the histologic appearance of lymphangiomas. Numerous neutrophils, nuclear dust, and purple granules characterize bacillary angiomatosis, while proliferating blood vessels, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts suggest granulation tissue."

            ],
            correct: 2,
            explanation: "The heart will eventually fail to maintain cardiac output if it is forced to work in an abnormal state for a prolonged period of time. The symptoms produced by congestive heart failure relate to whether the failure involves the left side of the heart or the right side of the heart. Symptoms of acute left ventricular failure include pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hypoxia, while chronic left ventricular failure will produce dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea (trouble breathing when lying down), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and eventually right heart failure. There are many causes of congestive heart failure, but basically they produce either systolic dysfunction or diastolic dysfunction. Systolic dysfunction may result from increased preload, increased afterload, or decreased contractility. Causes of increased preload (volume overload) include regurgitation (mitral and aortic regurgitation), anemia, hyperthyroidism, and beriberi. Note that diseases with increased cardiac output, such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, and beriberi, are classified as high-output failure diseases. In contrast, diseases that decrease cardiac output are called low-output failure diseases. Causes of increased afterload (pressure overload) include hypertension, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Decreased contractility can result from myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, drugs, and certain infections. Diastolic dysfunction results from decreased filling of the ventricles during diastole. Examples of this include mitral stenosis, infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis, and constrictive pericardial diseases."

            ],
            correct: 0,
            explanation: "One of the consequences of myocardial ischemia is chest pain, which is called angina. Angina is caused by a mismatch between the myocardial oxygen demand and the myocardial blood flow. There are three main types of angina. Typical angina (stable angina) is the most common type and is characterized by pain that results from exercise, stress, or excitement. The pain is promptly relieved by rest (which decreases oxygen demand) or nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is converted to nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator that increases perfusion to the heart. ECG changes in patients with stable angina are nonspecific and include T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression, which occurs secondary to ischemia of the subendocardium of the left ventricle. The second type of angina, Prinzmetal’s angina (atypical angina), is caused by coronary artery vasospasm and is characterized by pain occurring at rest. This pain may be relieved by calcium channel blockers or nitroglycerin. ECG in these patients reveals ST-segment elevation, which is the result of transmural ischemia. The third type of angina is unstable angina, which is characterized by increasing frequency of pain, increased duration of pain, or pain that is produced by less physical exertion. This final type of angina indicates that a myocardial infarction (MI) may be near, most likely due to the formation of a thrombus over an area of coronary artery atherosclerosis. In contrast to an MI, with angina there is no actual necrosis (infarction) of myocardial tissue, and therefore there are no increased cardiac enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), in the serum. Also, the pain of angina is not made worse with deep inspiration, a sign that is suggestive of pleural disease."

              "Troponin"
            ],
            correct: 4,
            explanation: "The clinical diagnosis of MI depends on correlating clinical symptoms, ECG findings, and serum cardiac enzyme changes. The classic description of the pain produced by an MI is crushing, substernal pain that may radiate down the patient’s left arm. This pain may be associated with sweating, nausea, and vomiting. ECG findings associated with MI include ST-segment elevation (which may return to normal), inverted T waves, and abnormal Q waves. Serum enzymes that may be elevated after an MI include troponin, CPK, SGOT (AST), and LDH, which are increased temporally in that order. The troponin complex is made up of three protein subunits: troponin I (Tn-I), troponin T, and troponin C. There are three isoforms of Tn-I: two in skeletal muscle and one in cardiac muscle (cTn-I). cTn-I levels begin to increase 4 to 6 h after the onset of chest pain, reach maximal serum concentration in about 12 to 24 h, and remain elevated for about 3 to 10 days. CPK exists in three isoenzymes, MM, MB, and BB, where M stands for muscle and B stands for brain. Elevation of the CPK MB isoenzyme is seen following an MI. Levels begin to rise at 4 to 8 h, peak at 12 to 24 h, and return to normal in 3 to 4 days. LDH exists in five isoenzyme forms. Normally serum LDH2 is greater than LDH1, but following an MI this ratio is flipped, that is, LDH1 is greater than LDH2. LDH1 levels begin to rise at 10 to 12 h, peak at 2 to 3 days, and return to normal in 7 to 10 days. New cardiac markers use monoclonal antibodies directed against myoglobin, CK-MB mass assay, and cardiac troponin levels. Myoglobin is a small monomer with a rapid rise and fall in serum (narrow window) that may be used to test the effect of “clot-busting” drugs, especially with rapid serial detection."

Most cases of STEMI are caused by thrombosis of a coronary artery overlying a previously stable atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerosis, however, does not affect the coronary arteries equally. Generally atherosclerosis affects the proximal 2 cm of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex artery, and the proximal and distal one-third of the right coronary artery. Anterior infarcts (such as infarction of the anterior left ventricle) result from occlusion of the LAD, as this artery normally supplies the anterior left ventricle, the apex, and the anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum. About 10% of transmural myocardial infarcts (STEMIs) are not caused by thrombosis overlying an atherosclerotic plaque. Less frequent causes of MI in these cases include coronary artery vasospasm (sometimes seen in association with cocaine use), coronary artery embolism (possibly in association with atrial fibrillation), coronary arteritis, or deposition of amyloid in the walls of the coronary arteries."

            correct: 2,
            explanation: "Areas of myocardial infarction (MI) undergo a series of changes that consists of typical ischemic coagulative necrosis followed by inflammation and repair. MIs less than 6 to 12 h old are not apparent on gross examination. By 12 to 24 h, there is pallor in the area of infarction, which is due to the trapped blood. On days 1 to 3, grossly the infarct develops a hyperemic (red) border and then becomes pale yellow over the next several days (days 4 to 7). By 7 to 14 days, the area of necrosis is surrounded by a hyperemic red-purple border of highly vascularized granulation tissue. Over the next few weeks, the area of necrosis changes to a gray-white fibrotic scar. Electron microscopic (EM) changes in MI can be seen at 20 to 40 min, but routine histologic changes are first seen at 1 to 3 h. These EM findings consist of signs of reversible injury (mitochondrial swelling and distortion of cristae) and signs of irreversible injury (mitochondrial amorphous densities called flocculent densities). The earliest histologic change is the formation of wavy fibers. These wavy fibers result from the pulling of the noncontractile necrotic fibers by adjacent viable fibers. Histologic features of coagulation necrosis are seen at 12 to 24 h. An acute inflammatory response consisting mainly of neutrophils is most pronounced on days 2 to 3, while macrophages predominate during days 4 to 7. The ingrowth of highly vascularized granulation tissue begins around day 7 and is maximal at 2 to 4 weeks. Note that at about days 4 to 10 the infarcted tissue becomes quite soft, and there is a risk of cardiac rupture. These events within the first few weeks are followed by scarring (fibrosis), which is well developed by the sixth week and is irreversible."

            ],
            correct: 3,
            explanation: "Cardiac rupture, whether of free wall, septum, or papillary muscle, occurs in only 1% to 5% of cases following acute MI. It occurs usually within the first week of infarction, when there is maximal necrosis and softening (4 to 5 days) and is very rare after the second week. Rupture of the free wall results in pericardial hemorrhage and cardiac tamponade. Rupture of the interventricular septum causes a left-to-right shunt. Serious mitral valve incompetence results from rupture of anterior or posterior papillary muscles. This valve incompetence can produce signs of mitral regurgitation, including a new pansystolic murmur along with a diastolic flow murmur. Indeed, the onset of a new murmur following a MI should raise the possibility of papillary rupture. Other common complications of MI include arrhythmias such as heart block, sinus arrhythmias, or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. These occur in 90% of complicated cases. Next in importance, but not in frequency (only 10%), is cardiogenic shock from severe left ventricular contractile incompetence. Milder left ventricular failure with lung edema occurs in 60% of these cases, while mural thrombosis with peripheral emboli may occur in up to 40%. Ventricular aneurysm forms a “bulge” of the left ventricular chamber; it consists of scar tissue and does not rupture, but may contain a thrombus.

            explanation: "Cardiac rupture is most frequent at 4 to 7 days post-MI, while fibrinous pericarditis usually develops around day 2 to 3. Pericarditis that develops approximately 1 to 3 weeks following an MI is called Dressler’s syndrome. This is an autoimmune disorder. Pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardium. Patients develop severe retrosternal chest pain that is typically worse with deep inspiration or coughing. Physical examination reveals the characteristic pericardial friction rub. ECG changes and pulsus paradoxus are also present. Pericarditis developing after a myocardial infarct is usually either serous or serofibrinous. Serous pericarditis contains few inflammatory cells and may also result from uremia or autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Serofibrinous pericarditis has a fibrinous exudate mixed with the serous fluid and may result from uremia or viral infections. Other types of pericarditis include purulent (suppurative) pericarditis with many inflammatory cells (seen with bacterial infections) or hemorrhagic pericarditis (seen with carcinoma or tuberculosis)."

Systemic HHD is the result of systemic hypertension, which causes left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. There is by definition no other cardiac disease present that could cause LV hypertrophy, such as aortic stenosis. Hypertension is a pressure overload on the heart, and as such it causes concentric LV hypertrophy without dilation. This type of hypertrophy is characterized by a parallel deposition of sarcomeres. Histologic sections may show myocytes with hyperchromatic and rectangular (“box-car”) nuclei. In contrast, eccentric hypertrophy is the result of volume overload on the heart. In systemic HHD the LV is stiff, as there is decreased LV compliance. Pulmonary HHD refers to right ventricular hypertrophy that is the result of pulmonary disease. By definition, this type of heart disease is called cor pulmonale. Pulmonary diseases that can cause cor pulmonale include diseases of the lung parenchyma, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial fibrosis, and diseases of the pulmonary vessels, such as multiple pulmonary emboli and pulmonary vascular sclerosis.

            explanation: "Aortic stenosis (AS) is usually the result of a bicuspid aortic valve (AV), degenerative calcification of a bicuspid valve, or rheumatic heart disease. Patients with aortic stenosis may present with angina (chest pain), syncopal episodes with exertion, and heart failure. Angina results from the mismatch between increased oxygen demand of the hypertrophied left ventricle (LV) and decreased blood flow, while syncope results from the inability to increase stroke volume as necessary with a stenotic AV. AS is the most common valvular disease that is associated with angina and syncope. The characteristic heart murmur of AS is a crescendo-decrescendo midsystolic ejection murmur that has a paradoxically split S2. In order to pump the blood into the aorta across a stenotic AV, the pressure in the LV must be much greater than the resultant pressure in the aorta. In order to produce this increased pressure, the LV undergoes concentric hypertrophy, which increases contractility. This concentric hypertrophy also makes the wall of the LV stiffer (decreased compliance). This stiff LV is unable to dilate until the time the LV starts to fail."

            explanation: "Clinical manifestations of aortic regurgitation (AR) include exertional dyspnea, angina, and left ventricular failure. Owing to the rapidly falling arterial pressure during late systole and diastole, there is often wide pulse pressure, Corrigan’s “water-hammer” pulse, capillary pulsations at the nail beds, and a pistol-shot sound over the femoral arteries. A blowing diastolic murmur is heard along the left sternal border. Volume overload of the heart is the basic defect and results in left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy. AR is rheumatic in origin in approximately 70% of cases. Much less frequently it is due to syphilis, ankylosing spondylitis (rarely), infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, or aortic dilation from cystic medial necrosis. Congenital forms of aortic stenosis occur fairly frequently, but AR is rarely congenital in origin."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "The normal mitral valve (MV) is a bicuspid valve with the anterior cusp approximately twice the area of the posterior cusp. The MV area is normally 5 to 6 cm². Clinically significant mitral stenosis (MS) usually results when the valve area decreases to less than 1 cm². MS most commonly develops as a consequence of rheumatic heart disease. It may also develop due to congenital abnormalities or calcium deposition. In patients with MS there is decreased flow across the MV due to the stenosis of the valve. In order to move the blood into the left ventricle (LV), the left atrial (LA) pressure during diastole is greater than normal and greater than the LV pressure. Instead of producing changes in the LV, MS causes the left atrium to hypertrophy and dilate. These changes predispose patients with MS to arrhythmias (which are felt as palpitations) and to the development of LA thrombi (which may lead to systemic emboli). The hypertrophied left atrium may also compress the esophagus (resulting in dysphagia) or irritate the recurrent laryngeal nerve (producing hoarseness). The increased LA pressure also causes a mid-diastolic murmur and can be reflected back into the lungs and to the right ventricle. In the lungs this produces venous congestion and hemorrhage, which cause dyspnea, fatigue, and hemoptysis."

            explanation: "Rheumatic fever (RF) is a systemic autoimmune disease that usually develops 10 days to 6 weeks after a pharyngeal infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. This autoimmune disorder results from cross-reactions between cardiac antigens and antibodies evoked by one of the many streptococcal antigens, e.g., streptococcal M protein. Rheumatic fever produces both acute and chronic manifestations. The major findings of acute RF include migratory polyarthritis of large joints, carditis, erythema marginatum of skin (although skin involvement is not very common), subcutaneous nodules, and Sydenham chorea. The acute cardiac lesions of rheumatic fever (carditis) are characterized by the accumulation of modified tissue monocytes (called Anitschkow myocytes) around areas of fibrinoid necrosis. This entire area is called an Aschoff body. The nuclei of the Anitschkow cells are long, slender, wavy ribbons that resemble a caterpillar (hence the name “caterpillar cells”). Occasional multinucleated giant cells (Aschoff cells) may be seen. The Aschoff body, which is pathognomonic for acute rheumatic fever, may be found in any of the three layers of the heart (pancarditis). In the pericardium, there is a fibrinous pericarditis, which is called a “bread and butter” pericarditis. The endocardial response in acute rheumatic fever is characterized by the formation of small friable vegetations (verrucae) along the lines of closure of the valves. In contrast, chronic RF mainly produces damage to cardiac valves. The mitral valve is most commonly involved, followed by the aortic valve. The stenotic valve has the appearance of a “fish mouth” or “buttonhole.” An additional finding in chronic RF is a rough portion of the endocardium of the left atrium, called a MacCallum’s patch."

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or dysplasia (ARVD) is a disorder characterized by an abnormal right ventricle that is dilated and has a thin wall that has been replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. Complications of ARVD include exercise-induced arrhythmias and sudden death. Some cases are related to mutations in the genes coding for either plakoglobin, desmoplakin (DSP), or plakophilin-2 (PKP2). Naxos syndrome (so named because it occurs only on the Greek island Naxos) is a similar disorder that is also associated with abnormalities of the gene coding for plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), an intracellular protein that links adhesion molecules in desmosomes to desmin. The clinical signs of Naxos syndrome are similar to arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, but hyperkeratoses of the plantar and palmar skin are also present. Endocardial fibrosis (EF) and Loeffler endomyocarditis (LEM) are two types of restrictive cardiomyopathies that are also associated with fibrosis of the ventricular endocardium. EF is primarily a disease of children and younger adults in tropical areas, while LEM is not restricted to these areas. In addition, LEM is often associated with an eosinophilic leukemia. It is thought that the release of major basic protein from these neoplastic eosinophils initiates the endocardial damage that leads to fibrosis."

            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Infective endocarditis is the result of microorganisms growing on any of the heart valves. These organisms may have either high virulence or low virulence. Highly virulent organisms, such as S. aureus and group A streptococci, infect previously normal valves and produce severe symptoms within 6 weeks. This abnormality is referred to as acute bacterial endocarditis. In contrast, organisms of low virulence, such as α-hemolytic viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis, infect previously damaged valves, such as valves damaged by rheumatic fever. These organisms produce symptoms that last longer than 6 weeks. This abnormality is referred to as subacute bacterial endocarditis. Infective endocarditis in IV drug abusers, which normally occurs on the tricuspid valve, is caused by S. aureus, group A streptococci, Candida species, and gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas species. Symptoms in patients with infective endocarditis are the result of bacteremia, emboli from the vegetations, immune complexes, and valvular disease. Bacteremia produces fever, positive blood cultures (several of which may be needed for confirmation), abscesses, and osteomyelitis. Embolization of parts of the large, friable vegetations can produce Roth spots in the retina, splinter hemorrhages in nail beds, and infarcts of the brain, heart, and spleen. Splenic infarcts produce left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain. Immune complexes can deposit in multiple areas of the body and cause glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, tender nodules in the fingers and toes (Osler’s nodes), and red papules in the palms and soles (Janeway lesions). Valvular disease can also result in perforation and valvular regurgitation."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Inflammation of the myocardium (myocarditis) has numerous causes, but most of the well-documented cases of myocarditis are of viral origin. The most common viral causes are coxsackieviruses A and B, echovirus, and influenza virus. Patients usually develop symptoms a few weeks after a viral infection. Most patients recover from the acute myocarditis, but a few may die from congestive heart failure or arrhythmias. Sections of the heart show patchy or diffuse interstitial infiltrates composed of T lymphocytes and macrophages. There may be focal or patchy acute myocardial necrosis. Bacterial infections of the myocardium produce multiple foci of inflammation composed mainly of neutrophils. Giant cell myocarditis, which was previously called Fiedler’s myocarditis, is characterized by granulomatous inflammation with giant cells and is usually rapidly fatal. In hypersensitivity myocarditis, which is caused by hypersensitivity reactions to several drugs, the inflammatory infiltrate includes many eosinophils, and the infiltrate is both interstitial and perivascular. Beriberi, one of the metabolic diseases of the heart, is a cause of high-output failure and is characterized by decreased peripheral vascular resistance and increased cardiac output. Patients have dilated hearts, but the microscopic changes are nonspecific. Hyperthyroid disease and Paget’s disease are other causes of high-output failure."

            explanation: "Plaques or vegetations are found in characteristic locations within the heart in several different disorders. Vegetations can occur in acute rheumatic fever as small masses found in a row along the lines of closure of the valves. In contrast, the vegetations of infective endocarditis are large, irregular masses that extend beyond the valves onto the chordae. Nonbacterial thrombotic (marantic) endocarditis, which is associated with prolonged debilitating diseases and cachexia, may produce one or two small, sterile vegetations at the line of valve closure. In patients with SLE, medium-sized vegetations (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) may occur on either or both sides of the valve leaflets, typically on the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve. The development of Libman-Sacks endocarditis is associated with the presence of the lupus anticoagulant (antiphospholipid syndrome), an antibody that makes platelets “sticky” and increases the chance of thrombosis."

            ],
            correct: 4,
            explanation: "White plaques involving the right side of the heart are associated with the carcinoid syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by episodic flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and cyanosis. These symptoms are caused by the release of vasoactive amines, such as serotonin, from carcinoid tumors. These substances are inactivated by enzymes such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the liver, lung, and brain. MAO-A degrades norepinephrine and serotonin, while MAO-B degrades dopamine. Cardiac symptoms are found in patients with liver metastases, which bypass the inactivation by the liver itself. The cardiac lesions producing carcinoid heart disease are found on the right side of the heart because these active metabolites are inactivated in the lung. The cardiac lesions consist of fibrous plaques found on the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. Microscopic sections of these plaques reveal smooth muscle cells and sparse collagen fibers in an acid mucopolysaccharide matrix. Similar lesions can develop with the use of certain diet suppressants or with ergotamine therapy for migraine headaches. Diet suppressants associated with these lesions include dexfenfluramine (Redux) and Fen-Phen (fenfluramine and phentermine). Redux increases serotonin levels by increasing release and decreasing uptake of serotonin in the central nervous system (CNS), supposedly increasing satiety. Phentermine decreases the appetite center in the brain by increasing norepinephrine levels through increased release and decreased uptake. In contrast to carcinoid heart disease, plaques in the left atrium are seen in chronic rheumatic heart disease and are called MacCallum’s patches. Vegetations also occur in rheumatic heart disease; these are small and are found in a row along the lines of closure of the valves. Amyloid deposits may be found in the heart secondary to multiple myeloma or as an isolated event, such as in senile cardiac amyloidosis. Grossly the walls of the heart may be thickened, and there may be multiple small nodules on the left atrial endocardial surface. Iron overload can affect the heart as a result of hereditary hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis. Grossly the heart is a rust-brown color and resembles the heart in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In hypothyroidism the heart is characteristically flabby, enlarged, and dilated, which results in decreased cardiac output. This reduced circulation results in cold sensitivity. Histologically there is an interstitial mucopolysaccharide edema fluid within the heart."

            explanation: "The cardiomyopathies (CMPs) may be classified into primary and secondary forms. The primary forms are mainly idiopathic (unknown cause). Most of the secondary cardiomyopathies result in a dilated cardiomyopathy that is characterized by congestion and four-chamber dilation with hypertrophy. The walls are either of normal thickness or they may be thinner than normal. This results in a flabby, globular, banana-shaped heart that is hypocontracting. The microscopic appearance is not distinctive. The ventricles may contain mural thrombi. The causes of secondary dilated CMP are many and include alcoholism (the most common cause in the United States), metabolic disorders, and toxins. Examples of the latter include cobalt, which has been used in beer as a foam stabilizer; anthracyclines; cocaine; and iron, the deposition of which is seen in patients with hemochromatosis. The anthracycline Adriamycin, which is used in chemotherapy, causes lipid peroxidation of myofiber membranes. One final form of DCM develops in the last trimester of pregnancy or the first 6 months after delivery. About half of these patients recover full cardiac function. Other forms of cardiomyopathies include a hypertrophic form, a restrictive form, and an obliterative form. In hypertrophic CMP the major gross abnormality is within the interventricular septum, which is usually thicker than the left ventricle. Constrictive (restrictive) CMP is associated with amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, endomyocardial disease, or storage diseases. These abnormalities produce a stiff, hypocontracting heart."

Primary tumors of the heart are quite rare; the most common in the adult is the myxoma. These tumors occur most often in the left atrium, and if pedunculated they may interfere with the mitral valve by a “ball valve” effect. Histologically they are composed of stellate cells in a loose myxoid background.

They are classified according to their location (membranous, infundibular, muscular) or to their size (large, medium, small). Small VSDs (<0.5 cm in diameter) are common and are usually located in the muscular septum. This type of defect, called Roger’s disease, produces a loud pansystolic murmur but causes little functional disturbance. These defects tend to close as the heart enlarges or the muscle hypertrophies. The clinical effects produced by VSDs range in severity according to the volume of blood that crosses the shunt. Patients with severe cases die secondary to left-sided congestive failure, while smaller shunts increase the risk for endocarditis. Classic signs of a VSD include dyspnea, poor growth (no cyanosis), and a pansystolic murmur over the left lower sternal border with biventricular hypertrophy. VSDs initially involve a left-to-right shunt, from the higher-pressure left side to the lower-pressure right side. This type of shunt, also seen with atrial septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and persistent truncus arteriosus, is initially acyanotic.

            explanation: "Left-to-right congenital shunts are not initially cyanotic, but cyanosis may develop later (tardive cyanosis) if the shunt shifts to a right-to-left shunt due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (Eisenmenger’s complex). Atrial septal defects (ASDs) illustrate this pathophysiologic effect well. The shunt with an ASD is initially left-to-right: left atrium to right atrium to right ventricle to lungs to left atrium. Cyanosis does not occur until later, when the shunt reverses, becoming right-to-left. This occurs because with time the pulmonary vessels become hyperplastic and irreversible pulmonary hypertension develops due to the volume overload to the lungs. The blood flow with an ASD that has reversed due to Eisenmenger’s complex is right atrium to left atrium (right-to-left) to left ventricle to aorta and then back to right atrium. An ASD with elevated pulmonary pressures allows emboli to enter the systemic circulation directly (paradoxical embolus). ASDs are the most common type of congenital heart disease that presents in adults; these individuals develop palpitations, exertional dyspnea, systolic flow murmurs, widely split fixed S2, and right axis deviation."

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "As the endocardial cushions join to divide the ventricles, the streams of blood from the right and left ventricles are divided as they flow out of the truncus. A spiral septum develops to physically separate the two streams of blood. The fusion of the spiral ridges results in division of the truncus into the pulmonary and aortic arteries. Occasionally the spiral is reversed, resulting in the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left. This is a complete transposition of the great vessels and produces two completely separate blood systems. This situation is incompatible with life unless some type of mixing of blood can occur between these separate systems. In utero, mixing of blood occurs across the atrial septum and via the placental circulation. Cases that survive to corrective surgery must have a persistent atrial septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus to allow mixing of blood. Therefore, the clinical goal is to keep the ductus arteriosus open. Normally, at birth, breathing decreases pulmonary resistance, reversing flow through the ductus arteriosus. This oxygenated blood (flowing from the aorta into the ductus) inhibits prostaglandin production, which closes the ductus arteriosus. To keep it open, prostaglandin E2 should be administered."

            correct: 4,
            explanation: "Increased intracranial pressure can result from mass lesions in the brain, cerebral edema, or hydrocephalus. It can cause swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema), headaches, vomiting, or herniation of part of the brain into the foramen magnum or under a free part of the dura. Brain herniations are classified according to the area of the brain that is herniated. Subfalcine herniations are caused by herniation of the medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere (cingulate gyrus) under the falx, which may compress the anterior cerebral artery. Transtentorial herniation, which occurs when the medial part of the temporal lobe (uncus) herniates over the free edge of the tentorium, may result in compression of the oculomotor nerve, causing pupillary dilation and ophthalmoplegia (the affected eye points “down and out”). Tentorial herniation may also compress the cerebral peduncles, within which are the pyramidal tracts. Ipsilateral compression produces contralateral motor paralysis (hemiparesis), while compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against Kernohan’s notch causes ipsilateral hemiparesis. Further caudal displacement of the entire brainstem may cause tearing of the penetrating arteries of the midbrain (Duret hemorrhages). This caudal displacement may also stretch the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve VI), causing paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle (the abnormal eye turns inward). Masses in the cerebellum may cause tonsillar herniation, in which the cerebellar tonsils are herniated into the foramen magnum. This may compress the medulla and respiratory centers, causing death. Tonsillar herniation may also occur if a lumbar puncture is performed in a patient with increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, before performing an LP, check the patient for papilledema."

The Arnold-Chiari malformation consists of herniation of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle into the foramen magnum, flattening of the base of the skull, and spina bifida with meningomyelocele. Newborns with this disorder are at risk of developing hydrocephalus within the first few days of delivery secondary to stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct. In contrast, severe hypoplasia or absence of the cerebellar vermis occurs in the Dandy-Walker malformation. There is cystic distention of the roof of the fourth ventricle, hydrocephalus, and possibly agenesis of the corpus callosum. Tuberous sclerosis may show characteristic firm, white nodules (tubers) in the cortex and subependymal nodules of gliosis protruding into the ventricles (“candle drippings”). Other signs of tuberous sclerosis include the triad of seizures, mental retardation, and congenital white spots or macules (leukoderma). Facial angiofibromata (adenoma sebaceum) may also occur. In von Hippel-Lindau disease, multiple benign and malignant neoplasms occur, including hemangioblastomas of the retina, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata; angiomas of the kidney and liver; and renal cell carcinomas. Patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a nonfamilial congenital disorder, display angiomas of the brain, leptomeninges, and ipsilateral face, which are called port-wine stains (nevus flammeus)."

            explanation: "Neural tube developmental defects are caused by defective closure of the neural tube. These defects, which may occur anywhere along the extent of the neural tube, are classified as either caudal or cranial defects. Failure of development of the cranial end of the neural tube results in anencephaly, while failure of development of the caudal end results in spina bifida. Anencephaly, which is not compatible with life, is characterized by the absence of the forebrain, replaced by disorganized glial tissue with vessels (cerebrovasculosa). Ultrasound will reveal an abnormal head shape with absence of the skull. Neural tube defects are associated with increased maternal serum α-fetoprotein (AFP), a glycoprotein synthesized by the yolk sac and fetal liver. Increased AFP is also seen in yolk sac tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma; decreased AFP is associated with Down syndrome. Risk factors include maternal obesity and decreased folate during pregnancy. Folate supplementation reduces the incidence of these defects."

            explanation: "Epidural hemorrhages occur in the potential space between the dura and the skull, usually after severe trauma causing a skull fracture. They result from rupture of a meningeal artery, most often the middle meningeal artery (branch of the maxillary artery), as the fracture is typically in the temporal area. Because the bleeding is arterial (high pressure), it is rapid, but patients may have a lucid interval before deterioration. The expanding hematoma increases intracranial pressure, which can lead to tentorial herniation and death."

            explanation: "Subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is much less common than hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, most often results from the rupture of a berry aneurysm. These aneurysms are saccular aneurysms that result from congenital defects in the media of arteries and are typically located at the bifurcations of arteries. They are not the result of atherosclerosis. Berry aneurysms are most commonly found in the circle of Willis, typically at the junction of the anterior communicating artery with the anterior cerebral artery or at the junction of the middle cerebral artery and the posterior communicating artery. The chance of rupture increases with age. Rupture causes bleeding into the subarachnoid space and produces severe headaches (“worst headache ever”), vomiting, and neck stiffness due to meningeal irritation.

Gross changes include watershed infarcts at the border zones between major cerebral arteries and laminar necrosis related to short, penetrating vessels from pial arteries. The earliest histologic changes, within the first 24 hours, include the formation of red neurons (acute neuronal injury), characterized by cytoplasmic eosinophilia, pyknosis, and karyorrhexis. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and the pyramidal neurons of Sommer’s sector in the hippocampus are particularly sensitive to ischemic damage and are most likely to demonstrate these early changes.

While there are many causes, the combination of alien hand, extrapyramidal rigidity, sensory cortical dysfunction, and tau-positive inclusions in astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and neurons is most suggestive of corticobasal degeneration. Cortical dysfunction in this syndrome includes language disorders and apraxia. Damage to the dominant parietal lobe can produce apraxia and Gerstmann’s syndrome (right-left confusion, finger agnosia, agraphia, dyscalculia). Déjérine-Roussy syndrome involves contralateral sensory loss with dysthesia; Parinaud’s syndrome involves impaired vertical gaze and pupillary abnormalities from upper midbrain compression; Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome) results from vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery occlusion."

            explanation: "Hypertension is a common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and promotes atherosclerosis in smaller distal branches of vessels. It also causes lipohyalinosis—lipid and hyaline deposition in cerebral arteriole walls—which weakens the wall and leads to small Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms that may rupture. Hypertensive hemorrhages often involve the lenticulostriate arteries (branches of the middle cerebral artery), producing lacunar or large hemorrhages in the corpus striatum, putamen, and internal capsule. They also occur in the cerebellum and pons and are often fatal.

            explanation: "In primary CNS demyelination there is loss of myelin sheaths with relative preservation of axons. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause, producing disseminated but focal plaques of primary demyelination anywhere in the CNS, often in the white matter near the angles of the lateral ventricles. It typically affects young adults between 20 and 40 years of age and follows a remitting-relapsing course. Symptoms include visual abnormalities, tremors, paresthesias, and incoordination. The classic Charcot triad is scanning speech, intention tremor, and nystagmus (mnemonic: SIN). Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), or MLF syndrome, is pathognomonic for MS and results from demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, causing medial rectus palsy on attempted lateral gaze and monocular nystagmus in the abducting eye with preserved convergence. CSF findings include increased T lymphocytes, increased protein, and normal glucose; oligoclonal bands may be present."

It presents with a combination of lower motor neuron signs (weakness, fasciculations, atrophy) and upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) without sensory loss. Early symptoms include weakness and cramping, progressing to atrophy and fasciculations. The triad of atrophic weakness of hands and forearms, slight spasticity of the legs, and generalized hyperreflexia in the absence of sensory changes is characteristic. The course is rapid, with death often from respiratory complications. Etiologies include oxidative stress from defective zinc-copper superoxide dismutase (SOD1) on chromosome 21.

It is characterized histologically by neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques with central amyloid cores. The amyloid is derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP). Cleavage of beta-APP by alpha-secretase prevents beta-amyloid formation, but cleavage by beta-secretase (BACE-1) or gamma-secretase generates fragments that aggregate into pathogenic amyloid fibrils. Beta-amyloid deposition is necessary but not sufficient for AD development. Early-onset familial AD is linked to mutations in presenilin 1 (chromosome 14) and presenilin 2 (chromosome 1)."

It is often caused by pineal region tumors, which may be germ cell tumors such as germinomas, teratomas, or embryonal carcinomas. Pineoblastomas occur in younger patients and are aggressive, while pineocytomas occur in older adults and are slow-growing.

This disrupts decussating fibers of the spinothalamic tract, producing segmental sensory loss in a 'cape-like' distribution. The most common site is the cervical cord, so MRI of the cervical spine is the best diagnostic test. Syringomyelia may also cause intrinsic hand muscle wasting and scoliosis, and can be associated with Chiari malformations."

            explanation: "Complete ipsilateral facial paralysis involving both upper and lower facial muscles indicates a lower motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve (CN VII). Lesions distal to the facial nucleus, such as in Bell’s palsy, cause inability to close the eye, loss of nasolabial fold, and drooping of the mouth on the affected side. Bell’s phenomenon (upward and outward rotation of the eye on attempted closure) and excessive tearing ('crocodile tears') may be present.

Low plasma levels of TSH would result in atrophy of the thyroid gland. In a person with Graves’ disease, the same changes in plasma levels of T4 and TSH would be present, but the thyroid gland would not be atrophied.

High plasma levels of TSH indicate inappropriately low levels of free thyroid hormones in the circulation, such as are present with autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland in persons with Hashimoto’s disease. However, because elevated plasma levels of estrogen in pregnancy increase hepatic production of TBG, the total amount (bound + free) of thyroid hormones in the circulation is elevated.

Even though prolactin levels are increased 10- to 20-fold at the end of pregnancy, the suppressive effects of estrogen and progesterone prevent milk production until after the baby is born. Immediately after birth, the sudden loss of both estrogen and progesterone secretion from the placenta allows the lactogenic effect of prolactin to promote milk production."

            "explanation": "Circulating levels of free T4 exert biological effects and are regulated by feedback inhibition of TSH secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. Protein-bound T4 is biologically inactive. Circulating T4 is highly bound to plasma proteins, especially to TBG, which increases during pregnancy. An increase in TBG tends to decrease free T4, which then leads to an increase in TSH secretion, causing the thyroid to increase thyroid hormone secretion. Increased secretion of thyroid hormones persists until free T4 returns to normal levels, at which time there is no longer a stimulus for increased TSH secretion. Therefore, in a chronic steady-state condition associated with elevated TBG, high plasma total T4 (bound and free) and normal plasma TSH levels would be expected. In this pregnant patient, the normal levels of total T4, along with high plasma levels of TSH, would indicate an inappropriately low plasma level of free T4. Deficient thyroid hormone secretion in this patient would be consistent with Hashimoto’s disease, the most common form of hypothyroidism."

            "explanation": "In the early stages of type 2 diabetes, the tissues have a decreased sensitivity to insulin. As a result, there is a tendency for plasma glucose to increase, in part because decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity leads to increased hepatic glucose output. Because of the tendency for plasma glucose to increase, there is a compensatory increase in insulin secretion, including C-peptide, which is part of the insulin prohormone. Hypovolemia and increased production of ketone bodies, although commonly associated with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, are not typically present in the early stages of type 2 diabetes."

This action of PTH, along with its effects to increase bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption, leads to hypercalcemia. However, because of the high filtered load of calcium, calcium is excreted in the urine. High plasma levels of PTH also decrease phosphate reabsorption and increase urinary excretion, leading to a fall in plasma phosphate concentration."

A deficiency in vitamin D leads to reduced synthesis of the active form of the vitamin 1,25-(OH)2D3. In turn, in the presence of low plasma levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3, the synthesis of calbindin in the intestine is reduced, resulting in impaired intestinal absorption of calcium. Impaired intestinal absorption of calcium tends to cause hypocalcemia, which stimulates PTH secretion. Increased PTH secretion contributes to the maintenance of plasma calcium concentration, in part, by increasing bone resorption."

In the face of increased serum osmolarity, there should be increased ADH secretion, which should then act on the collecting duct principal cells to increase water reabsorption and concentrate the urine. The fact that the urine is dilute, not concentrated, suggests that ADH either is absent (central diabetes insipidus) or is ineffective (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Administration of an exogenous ADH analogue separates these two possibilities—it was ineffective in changing serum or urine osmolarity; thus, it can be concluded that ADH unable to act on the collecting ducts, that is, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. One cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is hypercalcemia, which is present in this patent secondary to his lung cancer; he likely has humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, due to secretion of PTH-rp by the tumor. Dehydration would cause increased ADH secretion and increased urine osmolarity.

PTH-rp has all of the actions of PTH, including increased bone resorption, increased renal Ca2+ reabsorption, and decreased renal phosphate reabsorption; all of these actions lead to increased serum Ca2+ concentration. The treatment should be directed at lowering serum Ca2+ concentration, which can be achieved by giving an inhibitor of bone resorption (e.g., pamidronate) and an inhibitor of renal Ca2+ reabsorption (furosemide). Giving an ADH antagonist would be ineffective because the man’s nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has made his collecting ducts insensitive to ADH. Giving half-normal saline could lower his serum osmolarity temporarily, but would not address the underlying problem of hypercalcemia."

            question: "A 58-year-old woman presents with increased 'fullness' in her neck. Physical examination finds a single, nonfunctioning mass within the thyroid. She is euthyroid and her serum TSH level is normal. Histology reveals a single nodule composed of follicles similar to normal thyroid tissue, surrounded by a complete fibrous capsule compressing adjacent normal thyroid tissue. Focal invasion into the capsule is found. Tumor cells show the PAX8-PPAR-gamma fusion gene. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

            explanation: "21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Complete deficiency causes salt-wasting adrenogenitalism with absent mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid synthesis, leading to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, hypotension, and increased ACTH-driven adrenal hyperplasia. Excess precursors are shunted to androgen production, causing virilization in XX infants (pseudohermaphroditism).

It is independent of the renin-angiotensin system, so renin levels are suppressed. Aldosterone excess causes sodium retention (hypernatremia), potassium loss (hypokalemia), and hydrogen ion loss (metabolic alkalosis), leading to hypertension, weakness, and muscle cramps."

Suppurative infection in adjacent lung tissue, such as bacterial pneumonia, can extend to the pleura, producing a purulent pleuritis (empyema). Inflammatory pleural effusions result from increased vascular permeability, whereas noninflammatory effusions (transudates) are due to altered Starling forces, such as in CHF, hypoalbuminemia, or lymphatic obstruction."
